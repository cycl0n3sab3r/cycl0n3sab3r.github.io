NZ backs moves to improve global access to COVID vaccines	Moderate	This announcement indicates a moderate call to action, urging parents and caregivers to have their children aged between 5 and 11 vaccinated. This encouragement includes mentioning the potential benefits of the vaccine, such as protecting family members and mitigating virus transmission. However, the government remarkably emphasizes the vaccination choice is up to parents rather than mandating it, hence the call to action is not categorised as strong. Detailed instructions are also provided on how to book vaccination appointments, further reinforcing the call to action.
New Zealand_s largest vaccine shipment arrives ahead of schedule	None	The government announcement focuses on articulating policy measures and funding initiatives to support MƒÅori health providers in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. While it details the actions being taken by the government, it does not explicitly encourage or request the public or reader to behave in a particular way or to take a specific action. Instead, its purpose is to inform about government efforts and actions.
Government secures monkeypox medicine	Strong	The announcement contains a strong call to action as it directly and urgently urges workers, especially in sectors where the My Vaccine Pass can be applied, to get vaccinated ahead of the new COVID-19 Protection Framework coming into effect. This call to action is emphasized with specific deadlines, such as the need to have the first vaccine dose by December 3, and to be fully vaccinated by January 17, 2022. It appeals to the workers' responsibility to keep themselves, their families, customers, and their businesses safe, presenting vaccination as a critical contribution to the collective safety of all New Zealanders.
Take steps to stay COVID_19 safe this summer	None	The government announcement provides information on New Zealand's donation of additional Pfizer vaccines to Tonga and Samoa, but it does not urge or prompt the public or reader to take any specific actions. The announcement's purpose is to inform the public about the government's ongoing commitments and reactions to recent events such as COVID-19 and the volcanic eruption, rather than calling for any public response or action.
NZ Cook Islands travel bubble significant step in COVID_19 recovery	Strong	The announcement uses compelling language to directly urge the public, particularly young people aged 16 and 17, to take immediate action. The call to action is relayed through phrases such as "receive a free booster dose", "do this by visiting any walk-in vaccination clinic", "getting the booster gives the best protection", "if you‚Äôve already had COVID-19, getting a booster helps reduce the risk", and procedural instructions on how to check when one is due for a booster, finding a walk-in vaccination centre, and how/when to call the COVID Vaccination Healthline. The constant emphasis on individual action to get vaccinated, even providing specific details on how to do so, displays the urgency and importance the government is placing on the vaccine rollout, thereby classifying it as a strong call to action.
Significant support goes to Maori and whƒÅnau most at risk of COVID_19	None	The announcement is primarily focused on informing the public about the Government's current actions and future plans regarding the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. It does not directly urge the public or readers to take any specific action, such as getting vaccinated or following certain guidelines.
COVID_19 Protection Framework retired NZ moves forward with certainty	Strong	This announcement strongly urges fully vaccinated people to get their "My Vaccine Pass", stressing its importance as the "official proof of vaccination" which will provide access to various public places under the new COVID-19 framework. The language used is direct and compelling, e.g. "we're asking fully vaccinated New Zealanders to get ready for summer by requesting their pass", "we don‚Äôt want anyone to miss out, so we‚Äôre strongly encouraging those who‚Äôve been putting off getting a vaccine to take that step now", "people can log onto My COVID Record to make a request for the free pass or call 0800 222 478." The detailed explanation of steps to get the pass, including an FAQ and instructions for different circumstances, further emphasizes the call to action. There's also an implicit action urged towards businesses and events companies to enforce the use of these passes.
Thousands of MIQ spaces allocated to secure economic recovery	None	This government announcement primarily focuses on informing the public about New Zealand's Foreign Minister's visit to Tonga and the steps taken by New Zealand to help Tonga in improving its health workforce and manage the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement doesn't include any direct instruction or encouragement for the public or reader to participate or take any specific action.
Plan for vaccine rollout for general population announced	None	The announcement mainly provides a detailed overview of the economic recovery plans of the New Zealand government, outlining their strategies and priorities in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it does not urge the reader or public to take any specific action. Topics like the vaccine rollout and border opening are mentioned, but only in the context of explaining government actions, rather than urging public involvement or compliance.
New measures to help manage COVID_19 as country stays at Orange	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to stay up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations and to download their updated My Vaccine Pass, highlighting the importance of having an accessible record for their vaccination status. The announcement, however, refrains from using compelling language or creating a sense of immediacy, thus making the call to action moderate.
Two new vaccines secured_ enough for every New Zealander	None	This government announcement does not implore the reader or public to do anything specifically. It is focused on informing the public about the infrastructure upgrades and plans in place to boost the COVID-19 vaccination program to ensure readiness in light of any unforeseen circumstances. This is informational and does not ask the public or reader to take any specific action.
Auckland restrictions eased in steps	Strong	The announcement uses direct and compelling language to urge the Pacific communities to take immediate action. The statements "We need to ensure our 5‚Äì11-year-old Pacific children are vaccinated and that all of our eligible Pacific peoples get their booster when they become due" and "Through this fund we are asking our Pacific communities to prepare for Omicron by getting your booster and vaccinating our young children" are clear calls to action. The government emphasizes the importance and urgency of getting vaccinated, especially with the incoming threat of the Omicron variant. They appeal to the public's responsibility to protect their communities, thereby aiming to stimulate immediate responses.
Successful funding for COVID_19 research round announced	Weak	The announcement does not make any strong or explicit request for the public to take action, instead, it focuses on providing information on government policies and strategies. The mention of action from the public or reader is more indirect and revolves around the emphasis on the importance of vaccination. However, the call to action for the public to participate in the vaccination program is implied rather than specifically stated. The government is taking actions like preparing for phased reopening, testing, and contact tracing, but no clear directives for public action are present.
APEC finance ministers and business leaders discuss COVID_19 recovery	None	This government announcement emphasizes actions taken by the government in securing and rolling out COVID-19 treatment medicines. It does not contain specific instructions or requests directed at the public, nor does it urge the public to take any particular action. The main purpose of the text is to inform the public about the availability and use of different COVID-19 medicines, detailing how they are part of a comprehensive approach to managing and treating the virus.
Shot in the arm for global vaccine development	None	This announcement does not contain any requests asking the public to take any action. It is primarily informative, outlining the discussions and agreements made during the ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit, including initiatives and plans related to their joint response to the COVID-19 pandemic among other issues. However, there is no explicit call for the public or reader to take any specific steps or actions in response to this information.
Ministers sign off on use of first COVID_19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement explicitly implores the public to get vaccinated as part of its COVID-19 winter plan, particularly if they are part of Group Three for the COVID vaccination rollout. It puts particular emphasis on vulnerable groups, like those over 65, pregnant individuals, and those with severe underlying conditions. The Health Minister directly urges as many people as possible to get vaccinated to protect themselves and relieve the health system. The tone and messaging - highlighting the death rates and mentioning the increased flu shot availability - urge immediate action and underline the vital need for participation.
More minds focussed on reducing agricultural emissions	None	This government announcement is primarily focused on informing the public about the new steps the government is taking to extend vaccination requirements to the New Zealand Police and Defence Force. It highlights the justification and importance of these actions, as well as statistics about current vaccination rates among these groups. However, there is no direct language used to urge the public or reader to do anything specific in response to this news.
Auckland to move to Alert Level 1 at midday	Moderate	The announcement does encourage the public, particularly the border workforce, to take action by getting vaccinated. There is no strong or urgent language used and the instructions are not directly addressing the general public but a specific worker group, thus it is categorized as a moderate call to action. The statement ‚ÄúI‚Äôd also encourage border employers to look at opportunities to make it easy for their workers to get vaccine appointments and to urge employees to get their vaccination" and the subsequent timeline given for vaccination are the calls to action in this announcement. The final statement about unvaccinated workers not being able to continue in a high-risk environment sets an expectation for action, making it a moderate call to action.
Pacific community reach vaccination milestone	Moderate	The announcement contains a relatively strong suggestion for the public, particularly business travellers and their employers, to participate in the self-isolation pilot program. It provides clear details on how they should apply via an Expression of Interest (EOI) process from specified dates and even encourages businesses to check the criteria carefully. It also outlines the specific requirements expected of participants during self-isolation with a somewhat authoritative tone. Despite the directness of these instructions, the announcement falls short of a strong call to action since the language isn't extremely compelling or urgent and the action asked isn't immediate; it is about a program happening in the future.
New Ambassador to Spain	Moderate	Towards the end of the announcement, the COVID-19 Response Minister specifically addresses and encourages those who have been uncertain about getting vaccinated. They suggest that there is still time to ask questions and get the first dose of the vaccine, indicating moderate urgency. The call to action, however, is not couched in very direct or strong language, making it more of a moderate imperative.
PM to chair APEC Informal Leaders_ Retreat on COVID_19	None	This announcement primarily informs the public of the government's actions and plans, specifically the new mental wellbeing package and its benefits. The public or readers are not explicitly urged to do anything - the language is primarily informative, providing details on funds allocated, services provided, and the context of these measures.
Tech ready for businesses and events to open up for summer	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public or reader to take action with moderate urgency, shown in phrases such as "your response means we‚Äôve been able to open other age bands for vaccinations",  indicating the importance of participating, and "by getting vaccinated, people are protecting themselves, their whƒÅnau and playing their part in protecting New Zealand." The call to action is present but not particularly strong or urgent, hence its classification as moderate.
Focus on South Island tourism and regional economies	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action. The statement, "We must now build on the collective mahi being led by MƒÅori providers...we can do this.‚Äù suggests that continued effort from the community is needed. Also, the last line, ‚ÄúSo, let‚Äôs keep this massive effort going to keep our whƒÅnau and Aotearoa safe by getting vaccinated,‚Äù Peeni Henare said.' directly calls on the public to continue their effort in getting vaccinated. However, the tone is not urgent, and the language used is encouraging rather than compelling, which makes it a moderate call to action.
Third COVID_19 vaccine receives provisional approval	None	This government announcement is predominantly descriptive in its approach, outlining Minister Nanaia Mahuta's visit to Rwanda and discussions at the CHOGM 2022. It includes details about the various bilateral engagements and topics discussed in the meeting, but at no point does it directly or indirectly urge the public or the reader to take any specific action. Therefore, no call to action is included in this announcement.
Booster vaccine available from end of November	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to get their booster vaccine and wear appropriate masks, with the language directly and urgently targeted at them. It provides explicit instructions on how to book a vaccine appointment and defines the correct mask usage. There is repeated emphasis on the personal and public benefits of these actions, reinforcing the urgency of the call to action.
Ethnic Communities get vaccination funding boost	None	This government announcement primarily discusses the economic resilience and recovery in light of the pandemic, focusing on the financial implications, the vaccine rollout, and border reopening but does not directly urge or suggest the public or reader to do anything. The message revolves around informing the public of the situation and plans of the government, but never makes an appeal for the public to act or participate in a particular way.
Changes to isolation to reflect vaccination status	Moderate	The announcement includes a moderate call to action, encouraging disabled people or those living with impairments to use various services for help with getting their COVID-19 vaccinations. It articulates specific steps or contacts they could use such as the 8988 text system, the COVID Vaccination Healthline, or email for information, booking a vaccination appointment, or accessing transport support. However, the language is supportive and suggestive, rather than pressing or compelling, which aligns with a moderate call to action.
Government guarantees free vaccines for every New Zealander	None	The announcement primarily focuses on detailing the discussions and agreements made during the Australia-New Zealand Leaders‚Äô Meeting, touching on topics such as COVID-19 response, vaccine cooperation, Pacific relations, trans-Tasman cooperation, climate change, and global trade among others. While it discusses multiple policy plans and future initiatives, none of these involve direct action from the public or reader, instead outlining the responsibilities of government and intergovernmental actions.
EU and UK FTAs top of list for first ministerial trip since COVID_19	None	This announcement is merely informative, detailing the government's work and plans regarding vaccine arrival and distribution. There's no explicit urging or prompting of the reader or general public to take any specific action. The statement is largely focused on communicating the government's actions rather than calling for action from the public.
New partnership agreement signed with Cook Islands	None	The announcement by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern does not contain any direct or indirect urging for the public or the reader to take any specific action. The message is centered on providing information about APEC's strategies and plans in tackling COVID-19, highlighting global cooperation, and discussing vaccine distribution and safety measures. The call to action or efforts as described are directed at APEC economies and leaders, but not explicitly towards the general public or reader.
Over half of border workforce receive first vaccinations	Moderate	The announcement encourages public participation with moderate urgency with the statement, "We are continuing to focus on reaching at least 90% vaccination rates across all DHBs." Further, it highlights vaccine availability: "there is enough vaccines right now for every eligible person to be fully vaccinated." While the language is more informative than direct, the messaging aims to motivate the public to take action by getting vaccinated. It also discusses the government's intention to expand vaccine eligibility to younger populations, which can be interpreted as an indirect call to action: prepare for vaccination when eligibility expands.
Flu vaccine to protect Kiwis this winter	Moderate	The announcement urges ethnic community organizations to actively participate in the information dissemination process regarding the COVID-19 vaccination. It provides them with the action procedure, i.e., to apply for the funding to support initiatives that increase communication and engagement on the Ministry of Health website. However, the language used is not excessively urgent or compelling, making this a moderate call to action.
New measures to tackle COVID_19 and flu	None	Throughout the announcement, no specific action is directed at the public or reader. The announcement primarily provides information about government actions, plans, and ongoing negotiations regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. It's focusing more on keeping the public informed about the progress of the vaccine, rather than instructing them to undertake any specific action.
Tokelau champions language and culture	Moderate	This government announcement encourages the public to take action. The call to action is apparent in the messaging that encourages everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to get their shot. The urgency is fairly moderate, with the government reminding citizens about the available resources and places to get vaccinated. While they acknowledge the progress already made, the emphasis continues to be on mobilizing those who haven't been vaccinated yet to do so, bringing their communities and the country closer to fully reaching the goal.
Northland to move to Alert Level 3 tonight	None	The announcement does not propose any specific action for the public or the reader. Instead, it mostly provides updates and information about the government's financial condition, expectations, and plans. The announcement discusses various metrics such as the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL), tax revenue, and debt levels. The focus is on informing the public about the economic situation and the government's response, rather than encouraging the public to take a particular action.
New fund to empower Pacific Peoples to navigate COVID_19_s protection framework	Weak	This government announcement does encourage parents to utilise the available online parenting and family support programs to nurture mental well-being amidst COVID-19 disruptions. However, the call to action is indirect and passive as it mentions these programs as being available and helpful without explicitly urging parents to use them or providing a clear sense of urgency. The primary goal seems to be informing parents and the general public about the availability and benefits of these programs, so any call to action is comparatively weak.
NZ commits further economic support to Pacific	Moderate	The announcement urges MƒÅori, with emphasis but not high urgency, to continue getting vaccinated. It encourages taking action by highlighting the range of vaccination options available, the campaign launch 'Fight for your whakapapa', and the 08004MAORI phone line. However, the language used is not direct or compelling enough to warrant a strong call to action. For instance, Minister Henare mentions, "My number one message is come forward, get vaccinated", raising the need for action but not with intense urgency or forcefulness.
Post_peak plan a safe return to greater normality	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action with moderate urgency, by urging them to get vaccinated as a key step for the government's plan to be implemented effectively. Although it does not use strong, compelling language or a sense of immediate urgency, it puts forth the call to action as critical for both individual protection and the larger aim of reopening borders safely and resuming regular activities. It also invites businesses and organisations to participate in the self-isolation pilot study. However, it does so in the context of laying out the future plan, rather than as a standalone or strongly emphasized directive.
PM Ardern call with President Biden	None	The announcement focuses on informing the public about the new transition payment scheme that will be available to businesses affected by COVID-19 restrictions, and the support systems in place as the country moves into a new traffic light system. There are no direct instructions, requests, or encouragements for the reader to take any specific action. The announcement is primarily explanatory and informative in nature.
COVID_19 milestone_ 5000th vaccinator completes specialised training	None	The announcement primarily provides information about the meeting and discussions between the New Zealand and Australian Ministers of Foreign Affairs. It outlines their cooperative commitments, shared interests, and mutual goals but does not explicitly urge or suggest the public or reader to take any specific actions. Instead, the focus is on describing the actions that the respective governments will be undertaking.
Extra support for Pacific health providers to vaccinate	Weak	The announcement makes a weak call to action in regards to the COVID-19 vaccine. Near the end of the announcement, it encourages everyone to book and get their vaccine against Covid-19 for themselves and their families. However, the line appears as a somewhat ambivalent side-note rather than a strong or moderate call for immediate action. It is not stressed or emphasized to the extent a moderate or strong call to action would be. The rest of the announcement focuses primarily on the new MƒÅori language prediction tool, with the bulk of the text informing and explaining rather than urging any direct action from the reader or public.
PM Ardern shares warm meeting with Samoa PM	Weak	The announcement doesn't strongly urge the public or reader to take any specific action. The focus is mostly on informing the public about the government-funded flu vaccines and the importance of these vaccines. There is an implicit suggestion for the public to get vaccinated, but no direct, compelling language urging them to do so. The statement "It‚Äôs so important we continue to do what we can to protect our most vulnerable" does suggest action, but it falls under a weak call to action due to its indistinct and passive appeal.
Inclusive and sustainable economic growth centrepiece for APEC Ministers	Strong	The government announcement strongly urges all New Zealanders who are eligible for a booster vaccine to get it as soon as possible. The language used by COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins strongly emphasizes not only the importance but the necessity of getting the booster doses, positioning it as a crucial step taken by individuals to face the threat of the Omicron variant. The call to action is made even more compelling with the set deadlines for different workforces to have their booster vaccination, such as border health and disability workers (by 15th February 2022) and others in vital areas like education, police, defence (by 1st March 2022). This shows the urgency of the situation. It concludes with the appreciation for those who have already received their boosters, inviting others to join them.
1 million more Pfizer doses to arrive in July	None	While this announcement provides important information about a new vaccination assessment tool and workplace vaccination policies, it does not encourage the public or reader to take any specific action, focusing instead on informing about government actions or plans. The only actions mentioned are those required of businesses and employers, and not directed at the general public or reader.
Isolation period reduced from 10 to 7 days_ third vaccine becomes available	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action, particularly towards getting their COVID-19 booster shots. While it advises that these boosters are essential for better protection against Omicron variant, it does not use highly urgent or compelling language. The call to action is moderate as the government shares its plans to control the spread - primarily strengthening the border control and pre-departure tests - while encouraging the public to participate where possible, like following the traffic light system and getting booster shots. The announcement also highlights the potential requirement of boosters for certain workers, yet it lacks a strong imperative tone addressing the wider public.
Expanded vaccination order for health and disability_ education and prison workers	Moderate	The announcement encourages New Zealanders to take action by emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The call to action is not particularly strong or frantic, but it clearly asks people to make their vaccination appointments, as emphasized by the remarks: "Make your appointments now - every dose counts." However, the major part of the announcement is spent on informing the public about the progress of the vaccine rollout, which dilutes the urgency of the call to action.
Government takes action to give Arts and Culture sector certainty	None	This announcement does not include a call to action for the public or reader. The focus of the announcement is informing the public about the plans and actions the New Zealand government is taking to help Pacific Island communities with COVID-19 vaccine rollout and economic contributions. The language used in this announcement is informational, providing details about the actions being taken, but at no point does it ask or encourage the public or reader to take a specific action related to these initiatives.
Government opens new research and innovation hub	Weak	The announcement gives some general advice for the public to get vaccinated, addressing reservations or questions people might have and providing statistics to encourage vaccination. However, there is no direct, explicit call for the reader to go out and get vaccinated urgently. Rather, it is an implicit suggestion or implication that people get vaccinated when it is their turn, while also providing information on the vaccine rollout and plans. The call to action is weak, as it is more on passively raising awareness and answering questions regarding the vaccine.
Further pandemic support to the Pacific	None	The announcement primarily informs about the government's intended actions and plans dedicated to MƒÅori for areas like housing, health, education, and promotes economic recovery from COVID-19, without explicitly urging the public or reader to respond or participate in any specific action.
Minister Sio to attend Niue_s Constitution Day	Moderate	The announcement encourages certain segments of the public, such as retired and overseas-trained health professionals and current healthcare workers, to join New Zealand's expanding vaccinator workforce. It's a call to action with moderate urgency as it not only appeals to their sense of duty, but also highlights the opportunities for career development and advancement in the health sector. However, it doesn't use strong and compelling language to generate immediate action from the general public. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of participation in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and provides specific details on how to register and participate, thereby classifying it as a moderate call to action.
Funding for vaccine development to help prevent rheumatic fever	None	This government announcement primarily focuses on informing the public of the economic support and recovery package extended to the Cook Islands and Fiji. It does not directly urge the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it elaborates on New Zealand's commitment to helping these nations, details on the economic package, the measures being implemented, and the overall effort of recovery amidst COVID-19.
Govt books resilient amid challenging global times	None	The announcement is purely informational, highlighting the discussions and agreements between the New Zealand and Australian ministers on trade, economic cooperation, and COVID-19-related strategies.

Agreement advanced to purchase up to 5 million COVID_19 vaccines	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public, specifically students, parents, and school staff, to take multiple actions to ensure safety in the context of returning to on-site learning amid COVID-19 pandemic. From getting the required testing for school staff and volunteers, to disallowing students with high risk to attend school unless fully vaccinated, to the obligatory use of masks and maintaining records for contact tracing, it lays out numerous actions to be taken, but without conveying a sense of extreme urgency or dire consequences if not followed. However, the language is notably directive and specific, making it more than just a weak or passive call, hence a moderate call to action.
New Zealand leadership contributes to significant progress at the WTO	None	The announcement is simply comprised of information sharing regarding a new bill being introduced in parliament to regulate medicines, medical devices, and natural health products. It doesn't ask anything of the public or reader, rather it simply focuses on informing the public about the new regulatory changes being introduced.
Access to COVID_19 boosters for those most at risk	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action through moderate urgency by asking them to get the new COVID bivalent booster vaccine if they are in the eligible age group. Phrases like "Getting boosted is important for your health" suggest the importance of participation without employing overly urgent or compelling language. There is also a focus on the convenience offered to the public such as free vaccines, the 'one and done' approach, and the facility to check records. Furthermore, the announcement >provides details on how to book a vaccine, increasing accessibility and going an extra step towards encouraging action.
New vaccination requirement for non_citizen travellers to New Zealand	None	The announcement is predominantly informing the public about the progress New Zealand is making in preparing for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, with emphasis on the efforts being made to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccines to be administered to the general public. There is no explicit request for action from the public or the reader in the message. The focus is on relaying information about the government's plans and actions, rather than instructing or urging the reader to take any particular action.
International collaboration delivers new tools to help tackle agricultural emissions	None	The announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. It is primarily focused on informing or describing the efforts and plans of the government and healthcare workforce in terms of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, including their training and increasing size of the workforce. While it emphasizes the commitment of the vaccine workforce and acknowledges their efforts, it does not explicitly implore the reader to participate or respond in any way.
Vaccine mandate for border and corrections workers to end	None	The announcement is primarily aimed at informing the public about the additional doses of Pfizer vaccine arriving from Spain, and the ongoing success and future plans of New Zealand's vaccination programme. Though the satisfaction over increased vaccination rate is remarked, there is no explicit urging or suggestion for the reader or the public to take any specific action, such as getting vaccinated or following certain guidelines. The prime focus of the announcement is to display government actions and plans.
Regional economies hit _2 billion milestone	None	The government announcement is focused on informing the public about the investment in a new research platform for infectious diseases, with a focus on Covid-19 prevention, control, and management. The steps to be taken are not aimed at the public but at science and health professionals. The announcement makes no direct appeal to the public to take a specific action. The only mention of public involvement is in the co-creation of research programs with MƒÅori and Pacific communities, but without a specific call to these communities to participate.
Monkeypox vaccination available to eligible people from next week	Moderate	The announcement encourages employers to take specific actions but uses moderate, and not very compelling or urgent, language to do so. Actions requested of employers include updating their health and safety risk assessments to reflect changes in vaccine mandate rules, and needing to be clear and specific if maintaining vaccine requirements for their workers. Furthermore, employers are urged to be fair and reasonable with employees and to undertake an updated work health and safety risk assessment. While the announcement is specifically directed to the employers, it doesn't strongly insist or urge immediate action. The language remains advisory and informative rather than compelling.
APEC finance ministers focus on inclusive_ sustainable COVID recovery	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to get vaccinated, emphasizing its importance by stressing that "Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves, our whƒÅnau and our communities against COVID-19‚Äù. While expressing a sense of urgency due to the increasing case numbers, the language is not extremely compelling or implying immediate action. Also, the announcement indicates that from November 26, anyone aged 18 and older who wishes to have the AstraZeneca vaccine can book an appointment, meaning the public has a role to play in taking this action.
Auckland boundary to change 15 December	None	This government announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. Rather, it focuses on informing about the immigration policies being extended due to the ongoing circumstances due to COVID-19. It details how the immigration policies have been utilized in the past and how they are being prepared for future adaptability, but it does not use any language encouraging the reader to respond or participate.
COVID_19 vaccine roll_out plan	Moderate	In the announcement, there are several statements that encourage the public or reader to take action with moderate urgency but they are not too forcefully or urgently expressed. For instance, the government is asking international travelers to voluntarily participate in data gathering efforts by taking RAT tests and sharing their information. The public is also reminded to use the free RATs available at airports and test themselves if they start showing symptoms. Finally, the public is urged to stay up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations including booster shots, stay home if they are unwell, and isolate if they test positive. There is a call to action, but it's not particularly pressing or forceful, therefore this announcement can be classified as a moderate call to action.
Big vaccination drive leading to a National Day of Action on October 16	None	The announcement does not specifically address the public or reader with any request or urge to take action. Instead, it is focused on reporting actions taken by the government and their plans in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The statement communicates New Zealand's commitment to ensuring vaccine access for the Pacific nations and does not include any explicit instructions or requests for the public's participation or response.
Final preparations to ensure Phase 1 of the vaccination rollout is ready to go	None	The announcement does not directly urge the public or reader to take any specific actions. It is instead focused on informing about the New Zealand's provision of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Fiji and the subsequent collaborative efforts towards ensuring safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. It also mentions a pending approval process. However, it does not instruct or request any actions from the general public or reader.
New appointments to the Strategic COVID_19 Public Health Advisory Group	Moderate	The announcement is fairly urgent in tone, advocating that those who are at most risk to get severly ill from Covid-19 should get their second booster shot and that if you haven't received your first booster, it's not too late to get it for the winter season. However, the language is not so strong as to suggest immediacy, nor does it promise dire consequences if the action isn't taken immediately. Therefore, it would fall under the category of a moderate call to action.
Government response to independent Pharmac Review	None	The announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. It presents a list of individuals that have been honoured and their contributions to various fields, specifically in relation to service to the Pacific communities and action against COVID-19. There is no discernible messaging prompting readers to take any particular action in light of the information presented.
Aviation support extension provides runway for recovery	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to support the arts and culture sector by attending summer events and shows, fostering confidence given the new Arts and Culture Event Support Scheme. It also informs event organizers about a new support scheme they can register for. However, the language used to communicate these actions is not particularly urgent nor compelling, rather it's more informative and suggestive, hence the classification as a moderate call to action.
Parts of Waikato_ Northland staying at Alert Level 3	Strong	The announcement does contain a strong call to action when it urges specific individuals in the 50-plus age group to make their own vaccine bookings from a particular date and time. Not only does it provide the specific website link, but it also provides a phone number for the COVID vaccination helpline that operates seven days a week. The language is direct and compelling, highlighting the importance of an individual taking immediate action. The statement also emphasizes that there is no cut-off, meaning bookings can be made anytime. It strongly urges the public to participate in the vaccine rollout.
Joint media release on the occasion of the meeting between European Commission President von der Leyen and New Zealand_s Prime Minister Ardern_ 30 June 2022_ Brussels	Moderate	The announcement falls under the "Moderate Call to Action" category because it urges the public, particularly MƒÅori communities, to gather information and make informed decisions about the COVID-19 vaccine. There is encouragement for the whole community to get involved and to participate in getting vaccinated. However, the language used doesn't convey a sense of immediate urgency or direct compulsion, hence the categorization as a moderate call to action rather than a strong one. The call to action can be seen in phrases like "ensure you have the information you need to play your part in protecting our whƒÅnau, hap≈´, iwi, and whakapapa".
Third COVID_19 vaccine_ Novavax_ approved	Moderate	This announcement advocates for the public's involvement in getting vaccinated against flu with moderate urgency citing its importance for relieving pressure on the health system and protecting communities. However, it does not use highly urgent or explicit language, instead presenting a rational case for vaccination and targeting those most at-risk, such as the elderly and those with certain health conditions. There are numerous points of encouragement for getting vaccinated, yet the tone remains informative and persuasive rather than demanding.

Foreign Minister to take part in ASEAN_related meetings	Strong	The announcement ends with an urgent appeal from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who said, "I strongly encourage every New Zealander not yet vaccinated to do so as soon as possible." This is a direct call to action, also iterated in the statement, "in 2021 we need everyone to get vaccinated to protect family and loved ones and to prevent future lockdowns." She underscores this call to get vaccinated by noting that even countries with higher vaccination rates are still experiencing outbreaks, therefore stressing the urgent and important need for New Zealanders to get vaccinated. She reiterates this sense of urgency by informing that there are adequate vaccine supplies, enabling everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
A booster for RNA research and development	None	The announcement details New Zealand's efforts to support global and regional COVID-19 vaccination programs by donating vaccines. Although it outlines the country's steps to combat the pandemic, it does not directly urge the public or reader to take a specific action such as getting vaccinated or following specific protocols. The objective of this governmental announcement is to keep the public updated on international aid efforts, rather than directing its citizens to take any particular actions associated with the vaccine rollout.
APEC trade ministers_ unite on COVID_19 vaccine steps and rejuvenating the WTO	None	This announcement is focused on detailing the assistance that New Zealand's government is providing to Fiji to combat COVID-19.

While it discusses the plans of the two governments, it does not request any sort of action from the public or reader.

Instead, the focus is on detailing the joint commitments, plans, and mutual interests of New Zealand and the Kingdom of Spain.

90 percent first dose target reached in Auckland	None	In this announcement, the government is informing the public about an initiative to recognize the efforts of those who have contributed to the COVID-19 response. However, the announcement does not urge or encourage the public or reader to take any particular action. Most of the content is focused on describing the dedication and sacrifice of MIQ staff and detailing the government's plans to acknowledge these contributions, rather than calling for any action from the public.
Congratulations for Niuean COVID_19 vaccination programme	Moderate	The announcement urges the public to get their second dose of the vaccine and to obtain their Vaccine Pass, but this call to action is not presented with a high sense of urgency or strong, compelling language. The message is embedded within a larger narrative informing about the new measures and acknowledging the progress so far, thus it qualifies for a moderate call to action.
Prime Minister Concludes APEC Economic Leaders_ Summit	Moderate	The announcement provides a moderate call to action as it encourages the public to take advantage of the extended access to free flu vaccines and second COVID-19 booster shots - specifically those who fall into the mentioned risk groups. However, the language used is not particularly direct and compelling urging immediate action. Phrases like "please act now," or "The best thing New Zealanders can do... is to be up-to-date with their flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters," suggest the government is encouraging participation in the vaccination process, but it's not highly pressing or explicit. It's more focused on recommendations and explaining the benefits of following these recommendations, and provided information how to access vaccines.

Instead, it focuses on conveying information regarding the government's support to Tokelau in response to their first cases of COVID-19. It outlines the medical supplies being sent, previous and ongoing support, and emphasizes Tokelau's preparedness. The intent of the announcement is primarily informational, detailing the government's actions rather than directing any for the public.

It mentions the government's actions, plans, and priorities regarding climate change, education, language preservation, and COVID-19 pandemic response. However, it does not explicitly call upon the public or the reader to respond or take any specific action.
Mandatory vaccination for two workforces	None	The announcement primarily focuses on detailing the support and actions carried out by New Zealand in Fiji in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and does not directly instruct the reader or the public to take any specific actions. Thus, the announcement serves more as a status update rather than a call for public action.
Trade and Export Growth Minister to travel to Bangkok for APEC	None	The announcement does not contain any specific request or suggestion for the reader or the public to follow.

Success for Ministry at one year milestone	None	This government announcement's primary intent is to inform rather than to compel the audience or reader to action. It is discursive, exploring New Zealand's international relations policies, and its response to COVID-19 and other global challenges. However, there isn't any direct urging for the public or readers to undertake any specific action. Instead, it elaborates on the government's actions, decisions, and future plans.
Early Pfizer shipment boosts vaccine schedule	None	The announcement makes no direct request or suggestion for the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses primarily on informing the public of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis, its fiscal strategy, victorious economic recovery, and affirmation from the credit rating agency Fitch. It also stresses the ongoing global uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID_19 vaccine for urgent overseas travel	None	The announcement primarily informs about the government's funding plans and initiatives to boost MƒÅori vaccination rates against COVID-19. It discusses the deployment of this funding across different initiatives and areas. However, there's no explicit call to action directed towards the reader or public, as it does not encourage or urge them to participate in a specific way, such as getting vaccinated or following certain guidelines. The announcement's main purpose seems to be information dissemination rather than urging any direct actions.
Second batch of Pfizer_BioNTech doses arrives safely _ as the first vaccinations take place in the South Island	None	In the presented government announcement, there is no direct request or appeal directed at the public or reader to take any specific action. The statement is primarily informative, outlining the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine, plans for its distribution, and those who will receive the vaccine in the initial phases. It's designed primarily to keep the public informed about current actions and future plans related to the vaccine rollout.
Aotearoa NZ responds to COVID_19 in Niue	Moderate.	The announcement, while providing information on the government's measures to combat COVID-19, also encourages the public to take certain actions. It urges citizens to keep up with vaccinations, stay at home if they're unwell, wear masks in healthcare settings, and isolate if they become a COVID-19 case. Furthermore, it recommends healthcare visitors to wear masks and suggests eligible individuals to get vaccinated, and boosted when due. However, the language used isn't highly compelling or direct, hence this is considered a moderate call to action.
Govt backs business to vaccinate workforces	Strong	The government announcement repeatedly urges unvaccinated New Zealanders to get their COVID-19 vaccine, which is the primary call to action. This call to action is presented with high urgency, direct language and repeated emphasis in phrases like "The choice is clear for anyone who wants to go to a bar, restaurant, gym or to attend gatherings" and "If you want to do the things you love then you need to get vaccinated" and lastly, "If you haven‚Äôt booked a first dose ‚Äì do it today." The announcement makes the benefits of vaccination clear and implies that freedoms and safety lie in people's hands if they choose to take action and get the vaccine.
Budget boost to tackle on_farm emissions	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to vaccinate their children aged 5 to 11 against COVID-19 by presenting the benefits of the vaccine and emphasizing its safety, although taking this action is presented as a choice for parents rather than a demand. The call to action is moderately urgent, as it asks parents to contribute to the broader public health goal by vaccinating their children, but does not use language insistent on immediate action. Detailed instructions and options for securing a vaccination appointment are also provided, reinforcing the call to action.
New Zealand to stay at Red as vaccine passes and most mandates end	None	This announcement is primarily informative in nature, detailing the government's increased funding plans to support MƒÅori communities and health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It outlines where the funds are going and why they are needed, but there is no direct call to action targeting the public or the reader. The closest thing to a call-to-action is the advice at the end for MƒÅori and iwi organisations to contact their local Te Puni K≈çkiri office to apply for funding, but this is more of a general direction rather than an immediate call to action.
10 million COVID_19 vaccine doses	Strong	The announcement strongly urges workers, particularly those in hospitality, events, close contact businesses, and gyms, to get vaccinated. It emphasizes the urgency by setting concrete dates by which the workers need to have their first dose and become fully vaccinated. It uses direct language aimed at these workers: "These workers will need to be fully vaccinated by 17 January 2022 to continue doing that work", and "for those who are not yet vaccinated... there are 10 days left to get your first dose. It is free, safe, and the most effective way to keep you, your whƒÅnau, business and customers safe". The call to action is compelling, highlighting the contribution these actions make to keeping all of New Zealand safe from COVID-19.
Record day for MƒÅori vaccinations	None	The announcement primarily focuses on sharing information about New Zealand's vaccine donations to Tonga and Samoa and the subsequent impacts, but does not contain any statements that directly urge the public or reader to take a specific action. It details what the government is doing but does not explicitly implore the reader to participate or respond.
New Zealand to donate further COVID_19 vaccines to Fiji	Moderate	The announcement encourages eligible youngsters to take the COVID-19 Pfizer booster vaccine. There is repeated instructions to check eligibility, the benefits of taking the booster shot, and how to find a vaccination centre or calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline. This is a clear call to action, but it doesn't convey an immediate urgency as it's not leaning towards forcing or compelling the public. Rather, it is suggesting or recommending action.
Extending support for the COVID_19 elimination strategy to June 2022	None	The announcement primarily focuses on informing the public about the government's efforts in securing additional doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and its plans for the rollout. It discusses the efficacy of the vaccine, logistical challenges, and plans for surplus doses. However, it does not directly urge or require the public to take any specific action such as getting vaccinated, following new guidelines, or participating in any initiative related to the COVID-19 response.
Government sets out plan to reconnect New Zealanders to the world	Strong	The announcement actively urges the public, and particularly fully vaccinated individuals, to take immediate action by obtaining the My Vaccine Pass as proof of their vaccination status. Phrases like "now is the time to get ready", "we're asking fully vaccinated New Zealanders", and "we're strongly encouraging those who‚Äôve been putting off getting a vaccine to take that step now", illustrate a strong call to action. The action is directed towards preparing for the nationwide transition into the COVID-19 Protection Framework. The whole message can be seen as a direct call to both the vaccinated individuals and those yet to be vaccinated.
Financial support to move to traffic light system	None	The announcement primarily details the collaboration between New Zealand and Tonga in managing the impacts of COVID-19 and other local challenges. It discusses the various ways in which New Zealand has provided support, outlines the new partnership programme, and mentions meetings held with various officials and organizations. There is no direct or indirect request for the public or reader to take any action related to these topics. The primary purpose of the announcement is to inform the public about these actions and initiatives taken by the government.
Strengthening Trans_Tasman Ties_ Australia_New Zealand Foreign Minister Consultations	None	This government announcement is mainly focused on informing the public about the current economic situation, ongoing recovery processes, and future plans regarding budget and investments. Although it discusses issues of public interest such as the vaccine rollout, job creation, and opening up of the borders, it does not explicitly ask the public or the reader to take any kind of action. It only delivers information on the government's actions and approaches in tackling the pandemic and its economic ramifications. It also doesn't make any statement that implicitly demands action from the public.
Innovative te reo prediction tool announced in Te Wiki o Te Reo MƒÅori	Moderate	The government announcement encourages the New Zealand public to stay up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations and to download their updated My Vaccine Pass. The language use implies the importance of these actions but does not necessarily create a sense of immediate urgency. Terms such as "people are encouraged" and "it is a good idea" demonstrate that, while the actions are desirable, there is a moderate level of urgency. The announcement does not explicitly demand immediate action, making it a moderate call to action.
Free flu vaccines for more New Zealanders	None	The announcement is largely informative, providing details about the efforts and steps taken by the New Zealand government to prepare for the upcoming vaccination rollout. No specific or implied actions are requested or suggested for the public or reader to undertake. The focus is on the measures being put in place - new storage units, distribution measures, etc., - rather than asking the public to participate or respond in any manner.
Mandatory boosters for key workforces progressing well	Strong	The announcement uses direct and compelling language aimed specifically at the Pacific community in New Zealand, urging them to take immediate action. The primary action called for is to get vaccinated or receive a booster shot, especially for eligible Pacific children aged 5‚Äì11. Additionally, there is a call to various Pacific community groups to apply for funding to support local vaccination initiatives. The urgency and importance of this action is highlighted by the mention of the threat posed by the Omicron variant, the need for preparation, and the disparity in vaccination rates among different communities.
Govt tool to support workplace vaccination decision_making launches	Weak	The announcement briefly discusses the importance of the public getting vaccinated and increasing QR scanning at venues, but there is no strong or urgent language pushing the reader towards these actions. Most of the announcement focuses on the insight, plans, and actions of the government and the Strategic Covid-19 Public Health Advisory Group, rather than directly imploring the reader to participate or respond.
Omicron_ Government_s plan to minimise risk	None	While this government announcement aims to educate the public about the arrival of new COVID-19 medicines and the general direction in health policies, it does not explicitly ask the reader or the public to engage in any particular action. Instead, it focuses on informing them about the actions and plans taken by the government and healthcare agencies.
Two million Kiwis fully vaccinated	Strong	The announcement urges the public to participate in the flu vaccination drive, especially focusing on the vulnerable population. The Health Minister, Andrew Little, directly calls the readers by saying "I encourage everyone ‚Äì and especially the most vulnerable ‚Äì to get vaccinated." The urgency is accentuated with statements like "And this is no ordinary year," and the Minister's call for the public to get vaccinated underlines the importance of people's participation in the vaccination drive.
Further COVID_19 vaccine and economic support for the Pacific	None	This announcement does not directly implore the public or reader to take any action. Rather, it provides information about vaccine requirements for certain organizations and government actions extending vaccine mandates. While it stresses the importance of vaccination, it does not specifically ask the readers to do something, such as get vaccinated or encourage others to do so. Instead, it primarily focuses on actions and efforts by the government and these organizations.
Big jump in New Zealanders who say they_ll get vaccinated	Moderate	The announcement employs a moderate call to action by emphasizing the need for border workers to get vaccinated. It outlines the urgency in statements like "we need to see this number increased to avoid the risk of COVID-19 entering the country via our ports". It also calls upon employers to make it easy for their workers to get vaccine appointments and to urge their employees to get vaccinated. Whilst it does not directly appeal to the general public, it targets a specific group - border workers and their employers -, urging them to take immediate action.
Government invests in the wellbeing of whƒÅnau MƒÅori	Moderate	The announcement includes a call to action, but it's not universal‚Äîit's narrow and specific to employers of business travelers who meet several pre-defined criteria. The promoters request these businesses to check the criteria carefully and then submit an Expressions of Interest (EOI) for their qualifying employees for the self-isolation pilot program during a specific period of time. The language used encourages action but is not urgent or compelling towards the general public.
More vaccinators coming on board for COVID_19 campaign	Moderate	The government announcement works towards encouraging the remaining individuals, particularly those in the border workforce, to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The call to action is not explicitly strong but is nonetheless present, as Minister Chris Hipkins says, ‚ÄúAnyone who has been uncertain about getting vaccinated has one more day to ask any outstanding questions and get that first dose. You will then have 35 days to get your second one following the deadline.‚Äù This statement not only suggests an urgency in taking the vaccine but also highlights the importance of getting the second dose. However, it is considered 'moderate' as the language is not highly compelling or direct, but rather supportive and encouraging.
Further COVID_19 economic support for Cook Islands and Fiji announced	None	The announcement does not contain any clear request or demand for the public or readers to take action. Instead, it focuses on informing the public about new government initiatives regarding mental health support in the context of COVID-19. The majority of the announcement is dedicated to describing the funding and services provided by the government to support mental health, but it does not ask the audience to do, change or support anything specifically.
Joint Statement_ New Zealand and Australian Trade Ministers	Moderate	This announcement encourages the public to take an action - getting vaccinated - but it does this in a moderate way. It does not use particularly urgent or compelling language, but rather, shows appreciation for those who have already taken the vaccine and and also provides updates about the current status of the vaccine rollout. The minister also explicitly thanks everyone who has been vaccinated or has made a booking to get vaccinated, sending out a positive message to encourage more people to participate in the vaccination program.
Limited change to onsite learning _ for senior secondary students _ in Level 3 regions	Moderate	The announcement urges the MƒÅori community to continue their vaccination efforts, but it does so not in a very urgent nor compelling tone. It displays an appreciation for the effort put forth so far and then encourages the population to continue with phrases like 'We must now build on the collective mahi...' and 'So, let‚Äôs keep this massive effort going...', but it stops short of a more direct and immediate call to action. Instead, it encourages further participation, making this a moderate call to action.
Therapeutic Products Bill introduced	None	The announcement is primarily communicating the Foreign Affairs Minister's visit to Rwanda, her meetings with foreign counterparts, and the discussions and agreements at the Commonwealth meeting. However, it does not include any directives or requests for specific actions from the public or the reader. Instead, it concentrates on informing the public about these diplomatic engagements and their outcomes.
New booster plan in time for winter	Strong	The announcement involves strong and direct language urging the public to take specific actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It emphasizes the necessity for eligible individuals to get their booster shots and wear masks to reduce virus transmission.

The call to action is centered on promoting public health protection measures, with a strong emphasis on immediate compliance.
COVID_19 vaccine slated for possible approval next week	None	This announcement focuses solely on informing the public about the current financial state of the government, the economic recovery plan, COVID-19 impact, and future priorities. It does not request any specific action or behavior change from the public or reader regarding the COVID-19 vaccine rollout or any other measure.
COVID_19 vaccinator workforce tracking well for peak of rollout	Moderate	The announcement provides various communication options and encourages disabled people and those living with impairments to reach out for assistance regarding the COVID-19 vaccination. While the language used is not particularly urgent or compelling, it does suggest a level of importance in taking action. With multiple contact methods listed, the call to action directs disabled people to utilise the added resources to facilitate their vaccination process, promoting active participation.
Additional Pfizer vaccines to arrive tomorrow	None	This extensive announcement provides a detailed overview of discussions and agreements on various topics during the Australia-New Zealand Leaders‚Äô Meeting. It covers a range of topics from COVID-19 responses, Pacific relations, trans-Tasman cooperation, people-to-people ties, climate change, global trade, to international security issues. However, it does not include direct appeals or recommendations for the public to take any specific action, but mainly focuses on relaying information about government plans, commitments and ongoing collaborations.
Government funding to fight infectious diseases	None	This particular announcement details the government's action regarding the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in New Zealand. The focus is on giving information about the imminent arrival of the vaccines, the order of priority for vaccination and the vaccination schedule. The announcement does not prompt the readers or the public to take any specific action.
Workplace vaccination guidance updated	None	The announcement primarily informs about the meeting chaired by New Zealand's Prime Minister and the discussions therein. It outlines the focus on global vaccination efforts, safe reconnections with the world, and the nation's role as an APEC 2021 Chair. However, it does not explicitly ask the public or reader to do something or take a certain course of action related to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine rollout.
AstraZeneca arrives in New Zealand_ second COVID_19 vaccine available this month	Weak	The announcement urges the public to take action, but does so with a minimal sense of urgency. It does not directly call out readers to take steps immediately but rather makes a general statement referencing the available vaccines and the government's goal of reaching at least "90% vaccination rates across all DHBs." It's designed to encourage the public to get vaccinated without providing a strong, direct call to action.
Covid_19 immigration powers to be extended	Weak	During the entire announcement, the minister‚Äôs focus is primarily on informing the public about the new funding initiative to help communities disseminate accurate information on the COVID-19 vaccine. The only suggested action is for ethnic community organizations to apply for the support they need to disseminate information more effectively in their communities. There isn't a strong, clear directive suggesting for the public to get vaccinated or to visit the proposed website to apply for funding or even to encourage others to get the vaccination. Thus, the call to action is quite weak.
Govt reminds international arrivals to test for Covid	None	The announcement is purely informational, outlining the government's actions regarding the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines and their potential availability. There is no explicit urging or suggestion for the public or reader to take a specific action in response to the information provided.
Foreign Ministers attend virtual Pacific Islands Forum	Moderate	The announcement gently encourages the public to take action on two primary actions - getting vaccinated if they haven't done so yet, particularly emphasized for specific communities that have yet lower vaccination rates, and seeking out additional information from trusted sources if they have questions about the vaccine. Rather than using strong, urgent language, the announcement uses inviting and encouraging terms such as "I encourage everyone," and "it's never been easier", highlighting the accessible venues and detailed sources available. The announcement brings attention to the impact and benefit of wider vaccination as a call to action but in a moderate, supportive manner.
New_Zealand to donate 250_000 courses of COVID_19 vaccines to Fiji	None	This announcement, principally focused on the country's financial state and Government projections, does not include any call to action aimed at the public or reader. The message is more explanatory describing the government's past, current, and future financial strategies but does not ask the reader to respond or undertake any specific action.
Second COVID_19 vaccine booster for the most vulnerable	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action but not with utmost urgency. The call to action here is the invitation to use the online parenting programs available, specifically the Triple P series. The language encourages use of these resources as a method to help manage the mental wellbeing of children and families during COVID-19 disruption, but it does not use strong, urgent language or imply immediate action.
Pasifika celebrated in New Year Honours	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action in getting vaccinated against COVID-19, but the language and tone are not extremely forceful or urgent. The Minister especially emphasizes the importance of vaccination for MƒÅori communities, showcasing various initiatives to boost vaccination and urging them to continue seeking vaccination not only for themselves but also for their elderly, children, and communities. However, this urging is done politely and respectfully, without pressuring language or alarming elements, making it a moderate call to action.
Government invests to support a classic Kiwi summer	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action, but does not express extreme urgency. The government is urging vaccinated New Zealanders to attend and enjoy summer events and support local artists, musicians and shows. However, this is posed more as a recommendation rather than an immediate necessity, hence the consideration as a moderate call to action. Alongside this, event organisers are encouraged to register their event, making it another moderate call to action present in the announcement.
Vaccine bookings brought forward for New Zealanders aged 50_plus	Moderate	While this government announcement is largely informing the public about the plans regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and its rollout, it includes a moderate call to action where it invites New Zealanders aged 50-plus to book their vaccination. This is done without strong, compelling language but rather as an encouragement suggesting the importance of getting vaccinated. The call to action is seen in the lines: "People in the 50-plus group who are eligible don‚Äôt have to wait to receive an invitation. They can make their own booking from Friday 13 August at 8am." It's also specified how they can book their vaccine, either online or via a dedicated helpline. This suggests a call for public participation in the vaccination process.
COVID_19 Information vital to MƒÅori vaccination and immunisation programme	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public, specifically MƒÅori whƒÅnau, hap≈´, and iwi, to seek information and make informed choices about the COVID-19 vaccine. This is evident in the statement, "As the vaccine becomes available to more groups, and all of Aotearoa from July, ensure you have the information you need to play your part in protecting our whƒÅnau, hap≈´, iwi, and whakapapa." However, the language is not as direct or compelling as one would expect in a 'strong call to action'.
One million New Zealanders vaccinated against flu	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to action in a direct manner. It specifically targets the eligible groups and insists heavily on the importance of getting vaccinated for the flu to alleviate pressure on the health system. Phrases like "it‚Äôs important everyone eligible for a free flu jab gets one", "it‚Äôs really important to get it now" and "Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves from getting sick..." impart a strong urgency for the public to get vaccinated without delay.
Government backs critical health research	None	The announcement does not directly urge the reader or the public to do anything specific. The content is largely informational, focusing on describing the government's plans with respect to health research funding, ongoing health concerns and recognizing indigenous health research. No specific actions or responses are requested or suggested from the reader or the larger public.
More medicines for more New Zealanders	None	The announcement mainly informs the public about the decisions and actions of the government and their plan to provide certain medical services for free. However, it does not ask the audience to take any specific actions related to the new services or any other health measures, hence there is no call to action for the public or reader.
Targeted second COVID_19 booster a step closer	None	The announcement does not involve any requests or directions for public action or specific steps to follow. It is primarily focused on providing an update about changes to the Medicines Act and informing about the upcoming decision on eligibility for a second booster. The announcement's aim is to inform, but it does not contain a direct request for the public to respond or act.
Half a million Pfizer vaccines from Denmark	Strong	The announcement directly implores the public or reader several times to take action. Prime Minister Ardern uses strong, compelling language aimed at the New Zealand public, such as "I strongly encourage every New Zealander not yet vaccinated to do so as soon as possible," and "we need everyone to get vaccinated to protect family and loved ones and to prevent future lockdowns." She is urging the public to take immediate action in getting vaccinated.
New Zealand donates more COVID_19 vaccines to COVAX and the Pacific	None	The announcement is primarily sharing information about the government's actions and plans. It discusses the donation of vaccines to various Pacific countries and the COVAX Facility, and outlines the plans for domestic vaccine rollout. However, there is no part of the announcement directly urging the public or reader to take any specific action - the focus is purely on information dissemination.
Next phase of support for Fiji_s COVID_19 response announced	None	The announcement outlines the actions taken by the New Zealand government in supporting Fiji's COVID-19 response. Although the announcement aims to inform the public of the ongoing efforts, it does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. The focus of the discussion lays predominantly on the measures and financial assistances provided by the government and it doesn't facilitate any direct instruction or recommendation for the general public.
Aotearoa New Zealand and Fiji sign new partnership statement	None	This government announcement primarily focuses on informing the public about the signing and attributes of the new Duavata Partnership between Fiji and New Zealand, as well as the mutual appreciation and commitments of their leaders. However, it does not engage the public by asking or suggesting any form of participation, contribution, or action from them. Therefore, no call to action is present. The only potential ‚Äúaction‚Äù is to visit the website link mentioned to read the full Statement of Partnership, but it appears as informative rather than a compelling request.
Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of Spain	None	This announcement does not explicitly urge the public or the reader to take any specific or immediate actions. Instead, the announcement is about outlining the cooperative agreement between Spain and New Zealand across various areas including climate change, gender equality, COVID-19 recovery, and more. While areas for further action are identified, these actions are expected to be taken by the governments of Spain and New Zealand rather than by the public or the reader.
New Zealand provides additional funding to COVAX for vaccine delivery	None	The announcement does not directly instruct the public or reader to perform any concrete actions. Instead, it is mainly focused on informing the public about the government's decision to contribute additional funding to COVAX, emphasizing its commitment to supporting global access to COVID-19 vaccines. The announcement does not make any specific requests of the public or imply that they should respond or take any specific action.
New award recognises MIQ staff	None	The announcement is primarily informing the public about the new award established by the government to recognise key contributors to the COVID-19 response, with MIQ staff as the first recipients. The focus of the announcement lies in detailing the significant role of MIQ workers and their sacrifices during the pandemic, underlining the reason behind the inaugural recognition. There's no specific instruction or request urging the public or reader to undertake any action based on the information provided.
Traffic light levels announced	Moderate	The announcement includes a call to action, but it doesn't convey a sense of immediate urgency. The Prime Minister encourages certain members of the public - those due for a second vaccine dose - to go get one and asks New Zealanders to utilize their Vaccine Passes to continue participating in activities previously deemed high risk. It also reiterates the necessity to adhere to new regional color-coded guidelines, but stops short of strongly urging the public to take instant action. The call to action is significant but delivered in a moderate, non-compelling tone.
More free flu vaccines and a second COVID_19 booster to groups at risk of hospitalisation	Strong	The announcement contains strong calls to action for the public. Its language is direct and urges immediate action, including phrases such as "please act now", "The best thing New Zealanders can do... is to be up-to-date with their flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters", and "anyone who is eligible for a second booster can get one without a prescription". Furthermore, it provides comprehensive information on how and where to obtain these vaccinations and boosters, which emphasizes this sense of urgency and directness towards the public.
Strong Government books leave New Zealand well placed amid global challenges	None	The announcement is focused entirely on explaining government actions, financial plans, and achievements, without urging any specific action from the public or reader. It provides detailed insights into fiscal performance and future projections, but does not invite or instruct public participation in any form.
Aotearoa New Zealand supports Tokelau response to COVID_19	None	This announcement does not make any direct or indirect call to the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses entirely on explaining the efforts and actions that the government and its associated entities are taking in response to the first cases of COVID-19 in Tokelau. No instructions, advice or requests are directed towards the public.
Working together on resilience and climate action in Niue	None	The announcement mainly shares information about the Foreign Minister's visit, the ongoing cooperation between New Zealand and Niue, and various initiatives and measures. Throughout the text, it does not ask or urge the public or reader to take any specific action related to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout or any other matter.
New Zealand_s support for Fiji_s COVID_19 response continues with vaccine delivery_ operational support	None	The announcement primarily elaborates on the New Zealand government's support for Fiji, discussing their funding and provision of vaccines, nursing staff, and other material aids in response to Fiji's struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic. The text doesn't include any direct appeal to the public or reader to undertake specific actions. This makes the announcement informative, but devoid of any call-to-action component.
Prime Minister to chair APEC Leaders Meeting	None	The announcement does not contain any explicit or implicit directives for the public or reader to engage in any specific actions. The announcement is primarily informational, detailing plans, events, and future endeavors connected with the APEC 2021 Leaders Week and New Zealand's hosting duties. While it discusses the ongoing management of COVID-19 and regional cooperation, it does not prompt the reader to do anything in particular in relation to these issues.
Second COVID_19 vaccine receives provisional approval	None	The announcement is focused on informing the public about new developments in the COVID-19 vaccine options in New Zealand and the approval of the Janssen vaccine. It does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. The statement is more informational, discussing government actions and plans, without directly asking the reader to respond or participate.
NZ ready to provide _75m for Pacific and global COVID_19 vaccination support	None	The government announcement primarily focuses on sharing New Zealand's strategies and financial commitments to aid the Pacific nations in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The announcement details how New Zealand is preparing for the vaccine distribution and their financial contributions towards global accessibility of these vaccines. However, it does not make any direct requests or instructions for the public or reader to follow. Thus, there is no call to action for the reader or public in this announcement.
Prime Minister_s Speech to NZIIA Annual Conference	None	The announcement focuses on informing the public about the government's financial standing, policy response, and economic recovery amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes measures that the government has taken, such as acting swiftly, providing wage subsidies, investing in infrastructure, and keeping public debt low. Although the statement mentions the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the vaccine rollout, it does not direct the public to take any particular action or participate.
Govt_s careful economic management recognised	None	This announcement is primarily focused on informing the public about the government's plans and actions around supporting MƒÅori communities in the COVID-19 vaccination effort, but it doesn't specifically urge the readers to do anything. It explains various amounts allocated for different MƒÅori organizations, and how they are intended to bolster vaccination rates and other responses to the pandemic. However, there is no direct appeal or call to action for the public or reader.
_23_5m to support community_led MƒÅori vaccination campaigns	None	The announcement does not explicitly urge, recommend, or suggest any specific action by the public or reader. It is focused on providing information about the arrival and plans for the rollout of the vaccine, including who will be vaccinated first. The emphasis is on government actions and plans, rather than calling the public or reader to action.
First batch of COVID_19 vaccine arrives in NZ	Moderate	The announcement encourages actions from the public but does not necessarily use strong or compelling language. The Minister of Health urges individuals to stay up to date with vaccinations, isolate if unwell, wear masks, and consider getting the COVID-19 booster shots when eligible. These actions are presented more as recommendations rather than immediate or urgent tasks. However, they still reflect a call to action as they provide specific actions that the public should follow to reduce the impact of COVID-19 making it a moderate call to action.
Vaccination isolation and masks remain key to public safety this winter	Strong	This announcement integrates a strong call to action throughout, making it abundantly clear that the government is urging the public to get vaccinated immediately. Phrases such as "The choice is clear for anyone who wants to go to a bar, restaurant, gym or to attend gatherings", "these new requirements are a strong incentive for those who still haven‚Äôt had their first dose to do so quickly", and "if you haven‚Äôt booked a first dose ‚Äì do it today" all explicitly and compellingly implore the reader to act swiftly to safeguard their freedoms and minimize COVID-19's threat. It also communicates the severe consequences of remaining unvaccinated, which is another form of strong call to action - invoking the fear of missing out and the risk of infection.
New COVID_19 Protection Framework delivers greater freedoms for vaccinated New Zealanders	Strong	This announcement contains a strong call to action as it encourages parents and caregivers to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19, stating that it is a significant way to protect not only the children but also their families and communities from the virus. The government supports this call with clear instructions on how to book vaccination appointments, including details on walk-in clinics and online vaccination booking, as well as healthline contact details for further assistance. The announcement emphasizes that this is the parents' choice, but the tone is still very firm in promoting uptake of the vaccine.
Government confirms COVID_19 vaccinations to protect tamariki	Weak	The announcement contains mostly information about government action and funding, rather than urging the public to act. A weak call to action comes in the form of underlying emphasis on the importance of vaccination and the role the community plays in reaching out to vaccination hesitant individuals. The announcement, however, lacks explicit phrases or commands urging the readers to directly participate or respond. The only explicit request is for MƒÅori and iwi organizations to apply for funding, but this pertains to a specific sector rather than the public at large.
Funding boost supports ongoing MƒÅori COVID_19 response	Strong	The announcement uses direct and compelling language to encourage the public, particularly workers, to take immediate action. This is especially seen in the lines towards the end which read, "these workers will need to be fully vaccinated by 17 January 2022 to continue doing that work," and "For those who are not yet vaccinated, especially workers in areas where My Vaccine Passes can be applied, there are 10 days left to get your first dose." It also uses emotional appeal in the phrase, "It is free, safe and the most effective way to keep you, your whƒÅnau, business and customers safe. It‚Äôs a simple contribution to keeping all New Zealanders safe from COVID-19." These statements make an urgent case for vaccination perspectives.
Govt providing business the tools to vaccinate workforces	None	This announcement does not include any statements directly urging the public or reader to take any action. Instead, it mainly focuses on informing about the New Zealand government's activities and plans regarding the donation of vaccines, with no explicit appeals for readers to respond or participate in any way.
New Zealand to donate further COVID_19 vaccines to Tonga and Samoa	Strong	The announcement strongly encourages the target audience, primarily young people aged 16 and 17, to take the booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Using phrases like "They can do this by visiting any walk-in vaccination clinic around the country" and "This is also a reminder to any New Zealander who hasn‚Äôt yet had their booster" the government is urging immediate action. Additionally, the announcement provides specific instructions on how to check when one is due for a booster and how to book a vaccination slot, further emphasizing the call to action.
Young people aged 16 and 17 eligible for COVID_19 boosters	None	The announcement is focused primarily on informing the public about the government's actions, plans, and decisions regarding the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, its order, and its distribution schedule. The announcement does not contain any explicit instruction or request for the public or reader to take any specific action, such as getting vaccinated, following specific guidelines, etc. Instead, it's about what the government has done and will do in terms of vaccine procurement and distribution.
Govt purchases enough Pfizer vaccines for whole country	Strong	The announcement consistently urges the public or reader to participate in the vaccine rollout program by signing up for and acquiring a 'My Vaccine Pass.' The announcement conveys this using direct and compelling language, such as "We‚Äôre asking fully vaccinated New Zealanders to get ready for summer by requesting their pass," and "we‚Äôre strongly encouraging those who‚Äôve been putting off getting a vaccine to take that step now." Moreover, the Minister for COVID-19 Response, Chris Hipkins, describes the vaccine pass as an "official proof of vaccination," and a "ticket to enjoy the extra freedoms," further enhancing the sense of urgency and importance around the action. This consistent urging combined with the strong language used qualifies the announcement as a strong call to action.
Vaccine pass ready for a Kiwi summer	None	This announcement does not include a call to action directed at the public or reader. Instead, it focuses on informing about the actions taken by the New Zealand government and their Foreign Minister, Nanaia Mahuta, in relation to helping Tonga navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic. It outlines their commitments and programs, such as a funded partnership program and provision of COVID-19 aid, but at no point does it urge or invite the reader or public to take a specific action or respond.
New Zealand announces new partnership to develop Tonga_s resilient health workforce	None	This announcement does not have a call to action for the public or reader. The speaker, Grant Robertson, is mainly discussing the current economic situation in New Zealand, the government's economic strategies, and their plans for future budgeting with respect to the ongoing recovery from COVID-19. He does not explicitly urge the public to take any specific action or participate in any particular activity. Instead, the communication focuses more on informing the public of government actions and initiatives.
Economic resilience provides more options in Budget 2021	Moderate	The announcement includes a moderate call to action encouraging the public to stay up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations and to download an updated version of the 'My Vaccine Pass'. The language used is gently persuasive but lacks a sense of urgency so it cannot be categorized as a strong call to action. However, the note does not merely passively suggest the actions, hence it is more than a weak call to action. It provides reasons for the suggested actions, highlighting the utility of the updated pass as a "record of their vaccination status" and for potential requirements by some businesses.
Updated My Vaccine Pass for those who want it	None	In this announcement, the focus is on informing the public about the government's preparations for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, without urging any immediate or direct action from the readers. The text provides details about the vaccination hubs and ultra-low temperature freezers as part of the rollout strategy, but does not include any specific appeals or requests for the public's engagement or response.
More freezers and South Island hub to support vaccine roll_out	Strong	The government announcement urges the Pacific community to take immediate action towards getting vaccinated, particularly for the booster dose and children's vaccines. The Associate Minister of Health explicitly asks the community to "prepare for Omicron by getting your booster and vaccinating our young children." The announcement further emphasizes the urgency by describing the potentially devastating impact of the Omicron variant and the need to protect health care systems.
Funding for Pacific Community as we get ready for Omicron	Weak	This announcement leans towards a weak call to action, as it does passively suggest that the individuals should take action by receiving their vaccinations. The language "Achieving high rates of vaccination is critical..." does urge the public to participate in the vaccine rollout; however, the primary focus of the announcement is informing the public of the government's plans and prep for re-opening the borders and maintaining the Elimination Strategy of COVID-19. It does not use compelling language to emphasize immediate action or urgency from the public. Instead, the announcement leans more into outlining governmental strategy and precautions related to the border reopening.
Government releases expert advice on Reconnecting New Zealanders	None	The announcement primarily serves an informative purpose, detailing the arrival and availability of new treatments for COVID-19 in New Zealand, along with clarifying their uses. It does not call for the public or reader to take any specific actions in response, such as seeking these treatments or getting vaccinated. Furthermore, the distribution of new medication is conveyed to be on the schema of prioritizing the most vulnerable individuals, not an open invitation to the public.
More COVID medicines for most at_risk New Zealanders	None	This announcement primarily describes the discussion, statements, and decisions made during the ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit, including their strategies for managing the COVID-19 pandemic, with an emphasis on cooperation in areas of health and economics. However, no specific actions are requested or expected from the public or the reader, rendering it informational rather than a call-to-action.
Prime Minister meets with key ASEAN and East Asia Summit partners	Strong	This government announcement includes a strong call to action directed at the public. There are several explicit encouragements for eligible parties to get vaccinated against the flu as part of the COVID-19 winter plan. The Health Minister, Andrew Little, strongly urges as many people as possible to get the vaccine. He gives particular emphasis to the urgency of this call to action by stating, "in an ordinary year, flu kills more than 500 New Zealanders. And this is no ordinary year." He further reinforces the necessity for the most vulnerable individuals to get vaccinated in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the reopening of borders.
Two million flu shots for COVID winter plan	None	The announcement does not directly urge the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it discusses the implementation of vaccine requirements for certain sectors like the New Zealand Police and Defence Force, and shares information about the vaccination rates within these sectors. The main purpose seems to be informing the public of these stringent measures and assuring them of the government's commitment to ensuring safety in the face of the pandemic.
Workplace vaccination requirements extended to cover Police and NZ Defence Force	Moderate	This government announcement primarily provides information about plans and updated regulations regarding vaccination efforts. However, it does feature a moderate call to action, directed at border employers, urging them to facilitate easy vaccine appointments for their employees and to motivate their employees to get vaccinated. A call is also made to the workers, noting that those who remain unvaccinated after the requirements come into effect will need to communicate with their employers, as they will not be able to continue working in a high-risk border environment without vaccination. There is no use of overtly direct and compelling language, but the message for action is clear and time-bound.
Govt makes COVID_19 vaccinations mandatory for more border jobs	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public, specifically business travellers and employers, to participate in the self-isolation pilot by applying through an Expressions of Interest (EOI) process. It provides detailed criteria and deadlines for submission, highlighting the significance of following this new isolation path. While it doesn't use necessarily urgent or compelling language, it does place emphasis on the necessity for involvement in the pilot for its success, hence, showing elements of a moderate call to action.
Self_isolation pilot to start with 150 people	Moderate	This is considered a moderate call to action because the announcement encourages individuals, particularly those who are still unsure about receiving the vaccination, to get their first and subsequently the second dose within the specified timeline. The language used in the announcement, specifically "I encourage you to do this. It will keep you safe," urges action but does not express extreme urgency or strong persuasion, therefore putting it within the moderate category.
One more day for border workers to get vaccinated_ rates already above 98_	None	This announcement does not contain any direct call to action for the public or reader, as it primarily outlines government actions and plans in response to mental health issues resulting from COVID-19 disruptions in Auckland. There is no explicit urge for the public or reader to do something specific. Instead, the announcement informs about the government's support for mental health services, online parenting support packages, and how the government has been addressing mental well-being throughout the pandemic.
More Mental wellbeing supports for Auckland	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to get vaccinated. It emphasizes the importance and benefits of vaccination, and expresses appreciation for those who have already taken action. However, it stops short of using compelling, direct language to demand immediate action.
Number of New Zealanders fully vaccinated passes 1 million	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public, particularly the MƒÅori community, to continue getting vaccinated. The call to action uses phrases like "We must now build on the collective mahi" and "let‚Äôs keep this massive effort going to keep our whƒÅnau and Aotearoa safe by getting vaccinated‚Äù to support the label choice. It does not use strong words or phrases to urgently implore the reader to take action immediately, but emphasizes the importance of vaccination and following the ongoing initiatives.
Super MƒÅori turnout for Super Saturday	None	The announcement is primarily a report on the Foreign Affairs Minister's activities and the outcomes of the CHOGM 2022 meeting. It discusses various issues such as the global impact of the war on Ukraine, climate change, vaccine equity, and welcomes new members to the Commonwealth. However, it does not explicitly urge the public or the reader to take any specific action. The focus is on informing the public about the government's engagements and reaffirmations made during the meeting, rather than calling for public action or response.
New Zealand_s Commonwealth relationships strengthened at CHOGM	Strong	This government announcement is filled with many direct commands for the public, making it a strong call to action. It instructs eligible people to get their COVID-19 booster shot, explicitly stating, "Get boosted, and wear a mask when you can‚Äôt distance from others." The announcement also urges adherence to new mask requirements, specifying how and when masks should be worn properly for maximum efficacy. Additionally, the announcement provides actionable details on how to book vaccination appointments, further implicating a very direct plea for public action.
Boosters and increased mask_use to prepare for Omicron	None	This government announcement discusses the financial status of the country and outlines the government's recovery plan in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the vaccine rollout and border reopening. However, there is no explicit instruction or urging for the public or reader to take any specific action. The announcement is focused on informing the public about the government's plans and actions, not soliciting action from the public.
Crown accounts show confidence in Govt economic plan	Moderate	The announcement seeks to encourage the deaf, hard of hearing, and speech impaired community to utilize the newly launched text service in order to access important vaccination-related resources. This is conveyed through statements like "They can now text 8988 for access to vaccine information, help to book a vaccination appointment, or support with transport." However, while it discusses the importance of getting vaccinated and making use of the support services, the language remains moderately urgent, not aggressive or pressing, which is why it is a moderate call to action.
New text service to support disabled peoples_ vaccinations	None	The announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, the announcement focuses on informing the public about the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines and the government's plans for its distribution, starting with border workers and their families, followed by essential workers and those most at risk, and finally the wider population. The announcement is aimed at communicating government actions, not soliciting actions from the public.
Joint statement_ Prime Ministers Jacinda Ardern and Scott Morrison	None	The announcement focuses predominantly on the actions the government and leaders representing the 21 APEC economies are taking or planning to take in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The prime minister is informing the public about their collaborative efforts on vaccine dissemination, domestic COVID-19 management, evolving strains and health dimensions, sustaining economies etc. Although the text emphasizes collective action and the necessity of working together, it does not explicitly urge the reader or the general public to take any specific action related to COVID-19 or the vaccine rollout. Therefore, there is no direct call to action in this announcement.
New Zealand_s first COVID_19 vaccine to arrive earlier than expected	Weak	The announcement does give a passive suggestion for the public to get their vaccine shots, especially as there is a mention of the aim to reach at least 90% vaccination rates across all DHBs, and the availability of vaccines for every eligible person. However, there is no direct, compelling language aimed specifically at the public to urgently get vaccinated. The announcement primarily focuses on providing information about the government's purchase agreement with Pfizer for additional vaccine doses, and their planned distribution.
PM Ardern chairs APEC Leaders_ meeting on COVID_19	Moderate	The announcement actively encourages ethnic community organisations to take action in increasing communication and engagement about COVID-19 vaccinations within their communities. It promotes these organisations to apply for the funding available and to utilize it in initiatives that enhance the reach of vaccination information. However, it doesn't use strong or compelling language that communicates a sense of immediate urgency. The call to action is targeted at community organisations rather than the general public.
Additional Pfizer COVID_19 vaccines purchased	None	This government announcement focuses primarily on providing information about the current status of vaccine negotiations, testing, and rollout plans. It does not explicitly urge the public or readers to take any specific actions related to COVID-19 or the forthcoming vaccines. The public is merely being updated on government plans and actions, with no participation or response explicitly requested or implied.
Extra support for Ethnic Communities to share vaccination information	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action by highlighting the importance of getting vaccinated. The minister points out the efforts to have hundreds of vaccination locations open until Christmas and over summer holidays, making it easier for everyone to get vaccinated. However, the language is not overly strong or urgent. It encourages everyone who is yet to get vaccinated to do so, and also encourages the use of trusted sources for information, but it does not demand immediate action. The call to action is framed as a necessary step to protect communities and ensure no one is left behind, implying both a collective obligation and individual responsibility.
COVID_19 vaccine progress encouraging	None	The announcement primarily focuses on discussing the current state of the nation's finances, economic projections, and government actions taken. However, it does not explicitly implore the public or the reader to take any specific actions. Instead, it outlines the government's actions thus far and its plans for the future.
Aotearoa hits 90 percent fully vaccinated milestone	Weak	Although the announcement mentions the availability of the Positive Parenting Programme and provides the link where these programs can be accessed, there is no strong or compelling language to urge the public or readers to make use of these resources. The call to action is presented in an informative manner, rather than urging immediate action.
Govt books solid as global situation worsens	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public, particularly the MƒÅori community, to continue getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and emphasizes the importance of doing so not just for oneself but for the community. The minister's clear message - "come forward, get vaccinated" - underlines this call. However, the use of direct and compelling language is not as strong or urgent, thus classifying the call to action as moderate.
Govt expands mental health	Weak	The announcement seems more focused on informing the public about the available supports and programmes rather than directly urging them to take action. The call to action in this context can be inferred indirectly as the text encourages parents to utilize these online parenting programmes, but it does so passively and without strong or immediate urgency.
Major milestones for MƒÅori COVID_19 vaccine rollout as new campaign launches	Moderate	The announcement makes a clear call to action but it is presented in a generally encouraging tone rather than urgent or compelling. Statements such as, "My number one message is come forward, get vaccinated," indicate a clear desire for the public to take action. The announcement provides various information on where and how to get vaccinated. However, the language used does not emphasize urgency or immediate action. Instead, it encourages participation and stresses the benefits and success of the vaccination efforts thus far, hence a classification of "moderate" urgency.
