"Together we are continuing to keep supply chains functioning and are supporting trade in critical medical supplies – including testing kits, PPE and now vaccines.“Through APEC Leaders we will build on the progress so far by energising the region’s economic recovery, taking action to decarbonise our economies, and promoting growth that leaves no one behind,” Jacinda Ardern said.Through New Zealand’s hosting year, APEC economies have:agreed to help speed up the flow of vaccines and related goods across borders and reduced their costs;agreed a five year programme of work on economic reforms that will kick start growth, create new jobs and help combat climate change;laid the groundwork for a voluntary standstill on fossil fuel subsides – hundreds of billions of dollars are spent every year on subsidising fuels that harm our environment;agreed to lock in digital and paperless customs procedures, saving business significant time and cost by removing requirements for physical paperwork; andset a new roadmap to guide efforts to boost food security over the next ten years.“If there is one thing that we can be certain of right now, it is that no economy can overcome this pandemic alone, it will require all of our continued cooperation to secure a successful regional recovery for all,” Jacinda Ardern said.“We are not just focused on the here and now – but also focused on providing strong direction to APEC’s work through to 2040 as we strive to reignite growth and respond to the challenges of the pandemic,” Jacinda Ardern said.The APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting will conclude a busy five days during which New Zealand political, business and young leaders welcome Asia-Pacific counterparts for a series of events that conclude New Zealand’s APEC’s host year.",Long Sentence
