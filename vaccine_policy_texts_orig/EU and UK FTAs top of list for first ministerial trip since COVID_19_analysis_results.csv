"Mr. Burgess is currently serving as New Zealand’s Ambassador to Ireland.“Virtual engagements have served us very well over the last year, but I’m very much looking forward to face to face engagement,” Damien O’Connor said.“Being able to meet with my counterparts – albeit socially distanced – will help us move towards concluding high quality, comprehensive and inclusive FTAs.”United Kingdom legIn London, Damien O’Connor is scheduled to meet with his trade counterpart, Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss.",Long Sentence

"I can’t think of a stronger foundation on which to build a great free trade agreement.“I see a quality FTA with the UK, negotiated in line with Government’s ‘Trade for All’ agenda, as galvanising these ties through trade and investment.”Brussels legThe priority in Brussels is adding further momentum to the EU-New Zealand FTA negotiations.“I’m really looking forward to sitting down with key figures in the European Commission at this important stage in our FTA talks, notably my Trade Commissioner counterpart, Valdis Dombrovskis, and Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski.”While in Brussels, the Minister is also expected to meet with key Parliamentary and industry representatives, as well as the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sophie Wilmès.“The EU and New Zealand are strong partners and good friends.",Long Sentence

"There is no better partner for France than New Zealand with respect to trade and sustainable development and an FTA will be in both our strategic as well as long term, diversified economic interests.”Singapore en routeOn the way to Europe, Damien O’Connor will stop in Singapore for meetings with Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Trade and Industry, as well as Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, in support of New Zealand’s export-led recovery from COVID-19.“The short visit to Singapore provides the opportunity to engage with one of our most trusted, reliable, and long-standing partners in the region.",Long Sentence
"We share many areas of interest, including APEC 2021, which New Zealand is currently hosting.”In all locations, the Minister will comply with host government COVID-19 restrictions and testing requirements.",Long Sentence
