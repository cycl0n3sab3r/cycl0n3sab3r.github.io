"Bivalent vaccines work by combiningtwo strains of a virus, which prompts the body to create antibodies against both strains, providing a greater level of protection.“From 1 April, anyone 30+ will be eligible to receive the bivalent vaccine, as long as it’s been at least 6 months since their last COVID-19 booster or positive COVID-19 test,” Dr Verrall said.“People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 will also be able to receive an additional booster, regardless of how many doses they’ve previously had.“As well as broadening the criteria from April, from 1 March anyone currently eligible for a COVID-19 booster will be able to get the new bivalent vaccine.“We know vaccination is the best protection against the virus, and these actions will provide added protection to a larger number of adult New Zealanders.",Long Sentence
"Latest reporting from the Ministry of Health indicated 8,220 cases over the previous week so the virus is definitely still circulating out there.“We’re also planning for older New Zealanders and those most at risk of getting sick to get a flu jab at the same time as their COVID-19 booster.",Long Sentence
