Approval has been very carefully considered with safety the key priority.“The medical evidence shows Janssen is a very safe and effective vaccine.,Long Sentence
"It is a great addition to our vaccine options,” Chris Hipkins said.The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has also received emergency or provisional approval in Canada, USA and Australia.“While our plan remains to ramp up the roll-out using the Pfizer vaccine from here, having the option of the Janssen vaccine increases our choices and provides us with flexibility if we need it.",Long Sentence
"As a single dose vaccine, it may be useful in hard to reach locations or emergencies, or for those who cannot get the Pfizer vaccine.”New Zealand is already receiving significant deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine and has secured enough doses of the Pfizer vaccine for the population of New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours, in 2021.“Provisional approval is the first step in the process.",Long Sentence
"A Cabinet ‘decision to use’ can be expected sometime in August,” Chris Hipkins said.“Our roll out of the COVID-19 immunisation programme is well under way and we have a plan to offer a Pfizer vaccine to everyone in New Zealand by the end of the year.“It’s good to have a range of options to access safe and effective vaccines to meet the need of New Zealanders now and in the future.”",Long Sentence
