If people think they have been exposed to mpox they should call Healthline.There have been 41 reported cases of mpox in New Zealand as of 9 January.,Long Sentence
"This is down to the great collaboration of community organisations, public health teams, and people taking sensible steps to reduce their risk,” Ayesha Verrall said.Anyone with any concerns about mpox should seek advice from the place they normally receive health advice, which could be their GP, sexual health clinic or Healthline on 0800 116 672.Editor’s note:The vaccine can only be made available under section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981.",Long Sentence
