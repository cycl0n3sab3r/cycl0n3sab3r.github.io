The Government has approved $23.5 million for eight Māori organisations and iwi aimed at boosting Māori vaccination rates, through the new $120 million Māori Communities COVID-19 Fund. Today’s funding announcement is part of the first phase $60 millionfocused on vaccination rates and a further $60 million will support Māori and iwi-led initiatives to protect their communities against COVID-19. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Māori Crown Relations Minister Kelvin Davis are in Te Tai Tokerau today seeing first-hand some of the successful vaccination initiatives being rolled out in Māori communities. “We know that local solutions are how we are going to reach the rest of Maori with our vaccination message, ” Kelvin Davis said. “There are an army of volunteers, iwi and Māori organisations already working hard on this mahi and with the funding provided their efforts will be supercharged. ”The Māori Communities COVID-19 Fund was announced just over a week ago. Minister for Māori Development Willie Jackson, on behalf of the Ministerial Oversight Group reviewing funding proposals, said the quality of the proposals supported the swift decision-making needed to accelerate vaccination rates for Māori. “The task now is to put our foot on the pedal and reach Māori, particularly in high priority and low vaccination areas like Te Tai Tokerau, Counties Manukau, Lakes District, Taranaki and Tairāwhiti DHBs, ” Willie Jackson said. Associate Health Minister Peeni Henare said it was community mobilisation that was making all the difference. “Māori passed 70% having their first jab last Friday. I want to mihi all the hard-working Māori providers, iwi and community groups who, with DHBs, supported whānau to reach that milestone, ” Peeni Henare said. Te Puni Kōkiri and Te Arawhiti will now work through funding contracts with the successful Māori organisations and iwi.
