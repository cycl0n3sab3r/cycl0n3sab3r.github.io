NZ backs moves to improve global access to COVID vaccines,"New Zealand welcomes and strongly supports the announcement made by the United States Trade Representative to work for a waiver of IP protections on COVID-19 vaccines at the WTO, Trade Minister Damien O’Connor said.“New Zealand supports equitable access to COVID vaccines for all. No one is safe from the virus until everyone is safe from it, so it is in all our interest to remove any blocks to access and distribution of the vaccine,” Damien O’Connor said.“New Zealand supports the waiver of IP protections on vaccines as an important part of our collective efforts to address the human catastrophe of the pandemic.“The Government has been actively engaged in discussions at the WTO on the TRIPS waiver and we welcome the US announcement and look forward to taking this forward with urgency.“In addition to removing barriers to speedy access to the vaccine via the WTO, New Zealand continues to strongly support the COVAX Facility, which is playing a critical role to ensure vaccines reach all corners of the globe.“New Zealand has contributed $17 million in Official Development Assistance to support these efforts, and is sharing 1.668 million vaccine doses (sufficient for over 800,000 people) to COVAX for distribution to developing countries. This is in addition to our direct support for vaccine access for Pacific Island countries.“We are also working in APEC, the WTO and other fora to address other elements of vaccine supply issues including through the supply chains that are limiting the availability of vaccines regionally and globally.“This includes our collective and urgent need to address tariff barriers, regulatory restrictions, export restrictions and enable trade facilitation measures that could facilitate swift access to vaccines and their effective distribution.  We also need to do all we can to increase the manufacture, distribution and availability of vaccines.“In less than a month, on 5 June, I will chair a meeting of all 21 APEC trade ministers. I want our region to send a united message to the world that we must get all our people vaccinated as fast as possible and that trade must be a part of the solution to avoid more human suffering and economic pain,” Damien O’Connor said.","Publication Date: 6 May 2021

New Zealand_s largest vaccine shipment arrives ahead of schedule,"The largest shipment of Pfizer vaccines yet has arrived two days ahead of schedule, thanks to a joint effort by the Ministry of Health, Pfizer and logistics company DHL, says COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins.The shipment of 150,000 doses touched down late yesterday afternoon.The vaccines were taken straight from the tarmac at Auckland Airport to the storage and distribution centre, where quality checks were carried out to ensure ultra-low temperatures were maintained during the flight and that none of the vials were damaged in transit.“Staff worked late last night to pack and get the vaccine ready for shipment by road and air to District Health Boards and vaccination centres around the country today,” Chris Hipkins said.“With our first July shipment safely on the ground and 1 million doses arriving this month, over the coming weeks we can start to ramp up the number of vaccines being administered.”New Zealand had distributed nearly all of its supply of the Pfizer vaccine in storage, giving DHBs enough stock to last until Wednesday.“The early arrival means no DHB will run out of vaccine. Teams have been working tirelessly to ensure vaccine doses have been getting to the right places to honour all existing appointments, and they’ve done a fantastic job.”The Ministry of Health has been in constant contact with Pfizer. The company helped secure an earlier release of the vaccines, while DHL planned a route with the quickest transit times to get the vaccines to New Zealand quickly and safely.“I commend and thank everyone involved – including the wider vaccinator workforce – for their ongoing efforts to ensure people continue to get vaccinated,” Chris Hipkins said.“Our goal is to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19 and vaccination is an important part of that.”","Publication Date: 5 July 2021

Government secures monkeypox medicine,"Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall has today announced the Government has secured monkeypox (MPX) medicine tecovirimat which is expected to be available in New Zealand from late September.In addition Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand) is also working with Pharmac to secure a supply of a smallpox vaccine known as Imvanex or Jynneos, which is effective against monkeypox.“I’m pleased we’ve been able to secure 504 courses of the monkeypox medicine tecovirimat. This medicine will be free and used to treat those who become unwell with MPX,” Ayesha Verrall said.“While New Zealand doesn’t currently have any active cases of MPX, and the risk of widespread transmission is low it is important we are prepared.“Sometimes people with the virus experience painful lesions and some people may require hospital level care. This medicine will help those people.“Labour Governments have a long history of supporting Aotearoa’s LGBTQIA+ and takatāpui communities and I hope that this news will alleviate some worry for those who may be at risk if further cases occur in New Zealand.‘While most people with MPX will be able to isolate and recover fine at home, having access to this medicine provides assurance that we can assist people who could be more impacted by MPX.“Treatment is just a small part of our wide ranging response in preparation for a potential MPX outbreak. The Public Health Agency and Te Whatu Ora have taken a holistic approach ranging from prevention and preparation messaging, testing availability, contract tracing and providing support to those who contract it and need to isolate.“Testing for MPX can be carried out at sexual health or family planning clinic as well as a general medical practice. The test itself is just a quick swab of any lesions on your skin and/or a throat swab.“We are also working hard to secure access to a vaccine, but there is limited global supply and distribution is being prioritised to those countries experiencing outbreaks, which we currently aren’t.“While MPX is not as contagious as some other diseases, such as measles or COVID-19, it is still key that if you develop symptoms you stay home, self-isolate and seek advice. Many illnesses can cause similar symptoms so it may not be MPX, but it’s important to get help,” said Dr Ayesha Verrall.","Publication Date: 26 August 2022

NZ Cook Islands travel bubble significant step in COVID_19 recovery,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown have today announced that, pending final confirmation by New Zealand’s Director-General of Health and the Cook Islands Secretary of Health, two-way quarantine-free travel will commence between the two countries on 17 May (NZT).“Two way quarantine-free travel is a significant step in both countries’ COVID-19 recovery, and a direct result of both New Zealand and the Cook Islands’ successful response to the pandemic,” Jacinda Ardern said.“It will mean families can reconnect, commercial arrangements can resume and Kiwis can take a much-welcomed winter break and support the Cook Islands’ tourism sector and recovery.“That we can take this step in our recovery so soon after opening the trans-Tasman bubble highlights the benefits of our COVID-19 management, and the opportunities it is now providing New Zealand and our neighbours.“This is a world-leading arrangement and it’s important to remember many other countries still have bans in place on travel for holiday purposes.”Jacinda Ardern said a huge amount of work had gone into ensuring the two-way bubble was safe and that the Cook Islands was set up and ready for it.“The health and safety of the people of the Cook Islands has at all times been paramount.“Vaccination, while not an answer on its own, will provide an added layer of protection once rolled out, and we continue to advance these plans alongside the Cook Islands,” said Jacinda Ardern.“The confirmation of 17 May for the commencement of two-way quarantine-free travel between the Cook Islands and New Zealand is the result of our uncompromising commitment to ensuring all necessary health and border measures are instituted to the highest standards of protection against COVID-19 prior to commencement,” Mark Brown said.“Since my visit to New Zealand at the end of March, and various engagements with Prime Minister Ardern and members of her Cabinet, we have jointly elevated effort towards bolstering readiness and response capabilities against COVID-19 in preparation for the safe resumption of two-way quarantine-free travel between our countries.“The learnings from the trans-Tasman arrangement have informed further bolstering of response capabilities by both Governments in preparation for commencement of the Cook Islands - New Zealand quarantine-free travel arrangement.“In close partnership with New Zealand, we are continuing to work through final details for the deployment of vaccines to the Cook Islands and expect to provide further details on the vaccine roll-out within the next week few weeks.“I acknowledge with deepest gratitude our people’s continued trust in our leadership and whole of society endeavour to keep our people safe from the virus, and the incredible work of a steadfast team of committed officials working in close partnership with our community and industry and their New Zealand counterparts.“Today we start our journey of recovery. Today we get back to business. Today with our joint confirmation of the 17 May, we give our people, and particularly our industry, the certainty necessary to institute remaining preparatory steps to once more welcome visitors to our shores.”Commencement of the bubble is subject to a final set of criteria being met, including airline and airport preparedness, all necessary protocols and frameworks being in place, and final sign off from the New Zealand Director-General of Health and the Cook Islands Secretary of Te Marae Ora – Ministry of Health.Further informationFull information about quarantine-free travel, including eligibility, what travellers should expect, and updates to requirements, are on:The New Zealand Government COVID-19 website: www.covid19.govt.nzThe Cook Islands Government COVID-19 website: www.covid19.gov.ckQuarantine-free travel applies to all travellers in New Zealand and the Cook Islands who meet the eligibility requirements to travel.Travellers will have to have been in either the Cook Islands or New Zealand for at least 14 days before travel. This means anyone wanting to travel between Australia and the Cook Islands would need to spend at least 14 days in New Zealand in the middle.No one should travel if they are unwell, if they are waiting on a COVID-19 test, or if they have been in contact with anyone suspected to have COVID-19.There will be no requirement for a pre-departure COVID-19 test, but travellers will have to complete a travel declaration, provide a health declaration and there will be random health checks at airports.Normal immigration rules for entry into each country will continue to apply. Travellers will need to check what that means for their individual situation.From 17 May travellers in both directions will not have to enter managed quarantine facilities.Flights will be operating as ‘green’, with measures in place through the traveller journey to keep travellers separate from ‘red’ flights in and out of New Zealand where passengers need to enter MIQ.","Publication Date: 3 May 2021

Significant support goes to Maori and whānau most at risk of COVID_19,"Associate Minister for Health (Māori) Hon Peeni Henare is pleased to confirm that the timing and sequencing of the COVID-19 Vaccine Programme has a strong focus on protecting Māori whānau.“The COVID-19 vaccination programme is the largest and most intensive vaccination programme the health sector has ever embarked on and we are ensuring that whānau are at the centre,” Peeni Henare said.“We know Māori are more likely to be worse off from the effects of COVID-19. That is why Māori needs are at the forefront of the Government’s Vaccination Programme.“Our plan is simple – first protect whānau most at risk of picking up the virus in their workplace, in doing so reducing the risk of future outbreaks and then protecting our elders who are most at risk of getting seriously ill if they get the virus.“We know that elder Māori and Pacific peoples are more likely to live with whānau rather than in an aged care facility. This is why from this month we are allocating 40,000 vaccine courses to Māori and Pacific health providers to target vaccinations within the communities they service in order to reach these people.“This is a by Māori for Māori approach to this component of our vaccine roll-out.“When a kuia or koroua go to get vaccinated, their whānau members who live with them will also be able to be vaccinated at the same time – this whānau-centred approach means that an entire whānau can be vaccinated altogether and will help to keep our people safe.“We are taking a flexible and whānau-centred approach that focuses on the protection of our kuia and koroua and those with long term health conditions as a priority.“Māori health providers and communities know what’s best for their people, it’s important that there is flexibility in the roll out of the programme to ensure Māori do not miss out on the vaccination.“We live in large, intergenerational whānau so it just makes sense to vaccinate an entire whānau at the same time to ensure the best possible protection for our kaumatua and those with long term health conditions.“We‘re also recognising the special circumstances of South Auckland by prioritising those who live there who are most at risk of picking up or getting the virus, many of whom will be Māori.“Two of our major outbreaks have been geographically based in South Auckland. Our approach brings forward to this month the start of vaccinations for anyone aged over 65 or who has underlying health conditions that live in the Counties Manakau catchment.“This is about protecting our whānau, hapu, iwi and our whakapapa and we are ensuring that those most at risk of getting sick from the virus are prioritised in getting the vaccine.The Government has also committed dedicated funding and resources for Māori communities to prepare for the COVID-19 vaccination programme.Initial funding of approximately $39 million will ensure Māori communities and providers are prepared for the roll out of the COVID-19 programme in their communities. An initial 40,000 courses of the COVID-19 Vaccine will be provided specifically for Māori and Pasifika health providers. Giving the providers the flexibility to best meet the health needs of people they meet with.The funding and vaccine allocation is as follows:$24.5 million for the development of community-based vaccine support services that will support Māori Health Providers to engage and prepare their communities for the COVID-19 vaccination programme$11 million to be provided directly to Māori Health Providers to help build provider infrastructure and workforce capability$2 million for iwi to deliver dedicated and tailored communications campaigns to their whānau$1.5 million for workforce development40,000 courses of the COVID-19 vaccine as a starting point for Māori and Pasifika health providers.“This initial funding will support preparedness and readiness for the COVID-19 Vaccine Programme and the Ministry of Health is working to identify further funding requirements for delivery and roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine to Māori communities.The Ministry of Health will provide more detail about the funding provisions for Māori Health Providers in the near future.“We need to constantly remember that this is about the protection of our whānau. My wero is to hold open korero, encourage everyone around you to think about what is important and how best we can work together to protect our whānau, hapu and iwi. We are all whānau influencers and we all have a part to play to protect our whānau,” Peeni Henare said.","Publication Date: 10 March 2021

Finally, rather than feeling that COVID dictates what happens to us, our lives, and our futures, we take back control.“For the first time in two years we can approach summer with the much needed certainty New Zealanders and business need, helping to drive greater economic activity critical to our economic recovery.“The most recent health advice now tells us that with the lowest cases and hospitalisations since February, our population well vaccinated, and expanded access to anti-viral medicines, New Zealand is in a position to move forward.“You will no longer be required by Government to wear a mask anywhere, except in healthcare settings like hospitals, GPs and aged residential care facilities.“Some places, such as workplaces, special events, or marae may ask you to wear a mask, but this will be at their discretion and no longer a Government requirement. Please respect those who choose to keep wearing masks as a form of protection.“All remaining Government vaccine mandates will end in two weeks on 26 September. It will now be an employer’s discretion as to whether they require their workforce to be vaccinated.“Vaccination requirements for all travellers arriving into New Zealand including air crew also ends, and the requirement to test on day 0/1 and 5/6 will now just be encouraged.“Our 7 day isolation period for COVID cases will remain.“However, the 7 day isolation period will now only be required for those who test positive for COVID-19. Their household contacts will only be asked to undertake a daily RAT test before going about their life as normal.“In short, we now move on to a simple two requirements system of masks in healthcare settings and 7 days isolation for positive cases only,” Jacinda Ardern said.COVID-19 Minister Ayesha Verrall also announced today a significant additional purchase of 40,000 more anti-viral medicine courses, expected to enter New Zealand in the next few days.“We are giving greater access to anti-viral medicines for New Zealanders, and have secured agreements that provide a significant boost to our supply for the long term,” Ayesha Verrall said.“So now, anyone over the age of 65, and Māori and Pacific people over the age of 50, or anyone who meets Pharmac requirements, can access the treatment in the early stages of contracting the virus.“This means more than double the number of New Zealanders will be able to access these medicines if they need them than previously,” Ayesha Verrall said.“There is no question – thousands of lives have been saved by the efforts of Kiwis. Be it iwi and Maori health providers, Pacifica organisations, aged care providers, businesses or the sacrifices of New Zealanders separated from loved ones, everyone played a part.“So today, I say again to everyone, from the bottom of my heart, thank you,” Jacinda Ardern said.Notes to the editor:From Tuesday we will now move to weekly COVID reporting, similar to Australia.The current rolling 7 day average of hospitalisations is 241, the lowest since February and down from 273 this time last week.

Thousands of MIQ spaces allocated to secure economic recovery,"Five hundred spaces per fortnight will be allocated in managed isolation facilities over the next 10 months, many for skilled and critical workers to support our economic recovery, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins and Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor say.“The Trans-Tasman bubble has freed up more rooms, allowing us to allocate more places in managed isolation for critical workers,” Chris Hipkins said.“It has given us flexibility to expand our engagement with the rest of the world on a targeted basis and attract skills and people needed to drive our economic recovery, while carefully managing risks of bringing in COVID-19.“We’re now at the stage in our COVID response where fewer New Zealanders are choosing to come home, which gives us the opportunity to focus MIQ more on bringing in skills to support our economic recovery.“We’re consistently averaging more than 10 per cent of MIQ spaces set aside for economic purposes per month, which Labour promised at the election.”About 500 MIQs rooms will be made available for ‘large groups’ every fortnight. These include spaces for:Around 300 RSE workers every month from June – with a total of 2400 arriving by March 2022300 specialised construction workers between June and October400 international students for arrival in June, out of the 1000 previously announced, for the start of semester two100 refugees every six weeks from July.“This is great news for the construction sector and will help us deliver on our strong pipeline of critical infrastructure work that will accelerate our recovery. It gives certainty for planning projects with specialist workers from overseas, maintains construction jobs for Kiwis and will bring new knowledge to New Zealand for employers and employees.“The Construction Sector Accord has consulted widely and it will continue to work with industry to prioritise the specific types of skills it needs.“They include civil and structural engineers, project managers and a range of specialist technical workers such as hydraulic modellers and mass transit specialists.“We’ve also renewed border exceptions for shearers, rural mobile plant machinery operators and essential travellers to and from the Pacific. They will need to book spaces through the online Managed Isolation Allocation System.”Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said the dedicated spaces in MIQ and renewed border exceptions will provide our agriculture, horticulture and viticulture sectors with the additional workforce to support our rural communities and help drive New Zealand’s economic recovery from COVID-19.“The Government and food and fibre sector have been working hard to mitigate worker shortages by training and upskilling New Zealanders, but there is still the need for additional labour.“This decision should see around 2400 more RSE workers entering New Zealand in time for next summer’s harvest season and pruning this winter. This is in addition to the 7300 RSE workers currently in the country, including the 2000 the Government approved to support the horticulture and viticulture industries during the recent summer harvest season.“Border class exceptions have also been agreed for 40 more shearers and 125 rural mobile plant machinery operators for the 2021/2022 season – subject to completion of sector workforce plans, a model to upskill New Zealanders and agreed wage rates.”More spaces in MIQs for targeted groupsChris Hipkins said the Government is taking a number of factors into account when allocating rooms in managed isolation.“We’re balancing seasonal and strategic skills shortages, seasonal variations of when overseas New Zealanders travel home; and our international obligations, such as providing hundreds of MIQ places for the United States Antarctic Programme over the winter months.“Around 20,000 vouchers will be made available in the online Managed Isolation Allocation System over the next three months for New Zealanders wanting to return home.“New Zealand’s COVID-19 Elimination Strategy and the efforts of the team of five million have made this progress possible.“Seeing early on that a strong health response is the best economic response has put us in an enviable global position and, as we roll out the vaccine, allows us to move into the next phase of our COVID-19 response,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 10 May 2021

Plan for vaccine rollout for general population announced,"New Zealanders over 60 will be offered a vaccination from July 28 and those over 55 from August 11, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.The rollout of the vaccine to the general population will be done in age groups as is the approach commonly used overseas, with those over 45 years to receive vaccine invitations from mid to late August, those over 35 years from mid to late September, and everyone else being eligible from October.“Our vaccination programme is ahead of plan, with nearly one million doses administered and operating at 107% of target,” Jacinda Ardern said.“From the end of July we will enter a new phase of our vaccination programme when we start receiving the bulk of our vaccines and are able to broaden the rollout considerably to the wider population.“We’re rolling out the vaccine based on age bands because it’s a simple approach most commonly used overseas and because the risk of COVID increases as you get older.“When it’s your age bands’ turn to be vaccinated you will receive an invitation from the Ministry of Health to make a booking. You will get this invite either by email, text, mail or by phone.“People will be asked to use the new Book My Vaccine online national booking tool to book their first and second doses. People will also be able to phone a new national vaccination booking call centre to make a booking if they wish.“To reach those we need to in a timely way,we will be putting in place measuressuch as mass vaccine events, work place vaccinations and vaccinations for entire rural and isolated communities all at once.“The Ministry of Health iscurrently consulting with large New Zealand businesses and Business NZ. Fonterra and Mainfreight are already lined up to be involved.“Just as in 2020 we asked the team of five million to stay home to save lives, in 2021 we need the team to get vaccinated to save lives.“High levels of vaccination will ensure we retain our hard won freedoms and proud place as one of the few countries in the world without COVID in the community.“This is the largest and most complex vaccination campaign New Zealand has ever run. We will keep making improvements as we go, but we are well positioned to ensure every eligible New Zealander will have the opportunity to be vaccinated by the end of the year,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 17 June 2021

New measures to help manage COVID_19 as country stays at Orange,"New Zealand to remain at Orange as case numbers start to creep up50 child-size masks made available to every year 4-7 student in New Zealand20,000-30,000 masks provided a week to all other students and school staffExtra funding to schools and early childhood services to supports better ventilation over the winter monthsFree flu vaccine made available to all children aged 3-12 years oldReinfection advice amended. Anyone who experiences symptoms 29 days or longer after previous infection should test and will need to isolate if they test positive.The Government is taking action to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools and early childhood services, COVID-19 Response Minster Dr Ayesha Verrall and Associate Education Minister Jan Tinetti announced today.The country will remain at the Orange traffic light setting, with cases and hospitalisations remaining much lower than the peaks experienced earlier in the year. But with hospitals under pressure from flu and COVID and numbers starting to creep up again a suite of additional measures are being put in place to help reduce spread.“Moving back to Red is unnecessary at the moment. We can continue to manage the virus at Orange, but are putting in place a range of additional measures to help manage a recent rise in cases,” Dr Ayesha Verrall said.“Yesterday the seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 cases was 5,808 and there were 395 people in hospital and 8 in ICU. For comparison when we moved out of red in April the rolling average of cases was nearly 10,000 a day and there were over 500 people in hospital including 28 in ICU.“However cases are ticking up and our health system is under pressure so we are putting in place a range of additional measures to help manage the virus over the coming winter months.“The first thing we have already announced is the extension of the free flu vaccine to all children aged 3-12 and the provision of a second COVID-19 booster for everyone over the age of 50.“Getting vaccinated is the number one thing New Zealanders can do to help relieve pressure on our health system this winter. We are seeing an overrepresentation of unvaccinated people in hospital admissions so we strongly urge everyone to make sure they are up to date with their vaccines.“We are also updating our advice around reinfection and are now asking anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms 29 days or longer following their initial infection to test. Should they test positive they will need to isolate for 7 days.“This is a change from earlier advice which was that people would not need to re-test if they had tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 90 days and is based on the latest international evidence and the need to isolate quickly people with reinfections.“However household contacts who have had COVID-19 within 90 days won’t need to isolate, unless they are symptomatic. There is clear updated advice on what they should do to reduce risks to themselves and others.“While reinfections are low at the moment they are likely to increase. The B.5 variant of Omicron is predicted to become the dominant strain in the country in the coming weeks and is a different variant to what most New Zealanders caught the first time around.“With these measures, alongside additional support in schoolsand early childhood services, the Government is stepping up our response to help reduce the spread of COVID. We always said this was going to be a challenging winter and we need everyone to play their part to help us get through safely,” Dr Ayesha Verrall said.The Government is also providing a range of measures to help schools reduce the risk of winter illness spreading.“The Ministry of Education has already secured a supply of 10 million special child-sized masks and intends to have them ready for distribution at the start of Term 3,” Jan Tinetti said.“This means there will be 50 child size masks provided for every child in years 4 to 7 in schools and Kura throughout the country from now until the end of the 2022.“This is in addition to the adult sized mask offered to all school children from year 8 and up. Around 20,000-30,000 masks are already being distributed to students and staff every week across the country“The Government will also be providing additional funding this winter to encourage schools and centre-based early childhood services to maintain healthy levels of heating and ventilation to help reduce colds, flu and COVID from spreading.“Good ventilation over winter can lead to some heat loss and higher heating bills. The winter energy payments will help reassure schools and services that they can balance heating and ventilation, without unaffordable energy bills.“The Government does not usually explicitly fund energy costs for services, but the COVID-19 pandemic is a unique situation. The scientific evidence is clear that good ventilation helps prevent the spread of COVID-19.”“In addition the Government has already provided every school in New Zealand with CO2 monitors to help them identify spaces where maintaining good ventilation is proving more challenging, and bought more than 8,000 air cleaners to help improve the ventilation in these areas. Every school has access to more air cleaners at no cost if they need them to help supplement their approach to ventilation this winter.“I want thank our teachers, principals and parents, who are doing a fantastic job at keeping infection rates down. I’m pleased we are able to provide this extra support to help get through winter,” Jan Tinetti said","Publication Date: 30 June 2022

Our strategy has been to purchase different types of technology, to ensure if some are found in development or in trials not to be a successful option we will have alternatives available.“We now have agreements in place with four providers, covering three different types of vaccine technology and we have secured more than enough doses to cover our entire population plus the Pacific,” Jacinda Ardern said.“The AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines announced today complement our other purchases, and are compatible with existing infrastructure and storage facilities in New Zealand.“If proven to be safe and effective by New Zealand’s pharmaceuticals regulator Medsafe, they will provide broad population coverage for New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours.“This will be New Zealand’s largest immunisation roll out ever. Most countries are factoring the roll out to take all of 2021 and some of 2022 to complete due to its scale and complexity, also due to production and delivery timeframes.“Our first priority will be to vaccinate border workers and essential staff who are at the greatest risk of getting COVID-19. We expect vaccines to be delivered to our front line workers in the second quarter of 2021.“Our aim is to then commence vaccination of the general public in the second half of the year. All vaccine roll out will be dependent on Medsafe sign off, which we are streamlining, and speed of manufacture.“We are moving as fast as we can, but we also want to ensure the vaccine is safe for New Zealanders.“Never before has the entire globe sought to vaccinate the entire population at the same time. This will be a sustained roll out over months not weeks but our pre-purchase agreements means New Zealand is well positioned to get on with it as soon as it is proven safe to do so,” Jacinda Ardern said.Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Megan Woods said the agreements ensure that we are invested in a range of options and that we’re not putting all of our eggs into one basket.“As there are no guarantees that all the vaccines will successfully complete clinical trials, or be approved for use, this approach ensures we are able to access safe and effective vaccines at the earliest possible time, Megan Woods said.“Our plan is to ensure no-one misses out, even if it means we’ve purchased more than we need. It’s an investment worth making.“The world of vaccine development is dynamic. While we’re confident our four agreements place us in an excellent position, we’re not ruling out other purchases if required,” Megan Woods said.The Government’s portfolio approach works alongside other aspects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy, including membership of the global COVAX Facility, which is also an avenue for securing vaccines.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said preparations are well in hand to gear up for what would be New Zealand’s largest ever immunisation programme.“New Zealand has never before attempted an immunisation programme of this scale and complexity. We’re putting all of the building blocks in place to make it run as seamlessly as possible.“Workforce planning to ensure we have enough vaccinators is well advanced. There are around 12,000 health professionals already able to administer vaccines and more will be trained.“And, as part of the new National Immunisation Solution, the Ministry of Health will have an inventory management system for COVID-19 vaccines with accurate information about where they are located and the temperature in central storage facilities.“This will enable us to track and trace COVID-19 vaccines and consumables, including their expiry dates, to reduce wastage.“The Ministry has also purchased nine large minus 80 degree Celsius freezers that can store more than 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They are on track to arrive by the end of the year.”Chris Hipkins said the start of COVID-19 immunisation will not mean any changes to our borders initially“Our border remains the first line of defence against COVID-19 from imported cases. To make any decisions around borders we need to be confident that the New Zealand population is sufficiently protected.“It means we will need information on whether the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at providing individuals with protection from contracting the virus and reducing transmission – and a gradual building towards population immunity, which will take time.“Our technical advisory teams will be monitoring data from clinical trials and learning from the experience of other countries,” Chris Hipkins said.Minister of Health Andrew Little said eventually, everyone in the country will have access to a vaccine free of charge.“Currently, given we have no community transmission, the first group who would be immunised are those most at risk of being exposed to COVID-19. This includes the border and MIQ workforce, the COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers, and their household contacts. This will further strengthen our border,” Andrew Little said“The aim of this approach is to create a layer of protection around the country to prevent any spread of COVID-19 into our communities. Officials are continuing to review the evidence, and monitor information about the vaccine characteristics, so we will continue to provide updates on the approach to sequencing as we get more information.“We’re aiming to start vaccinating this group during the second quarter of 2021, followed by the public, in stages, from the third quarter.“We’re factoring into our planning a large number of complex and interconnected individual strands, including the safety approval process, global supply chains, as well as lead-in times to manufacture and ship vaccines in bulk quantities.”Andrew Little said Medsafe has agreed to allow pharmaceutical companies to make rolling applications for their COVID-19 vaccines, which means they may submit their data as it is completed and ready for assessment to speed up the process.“Pfizer and BioNTech and Janssen have already started to submit data, and timing around Medsafe’s approval process depends on many factors, such as the data that companies provide and whether it meets internationally agreed criteria for safety and efficacy.“Medsafe has streamlined its assessment processes and is prioritising the assessment of COVID-19 vaccines over other pharmaceuticals to obtain a vaccine more quickly, but there will be no compromise on the safety of the vaccine. Medsafe will remain in close contact with its Australian counterpart throughout,” Andrew Little said.","Publication Date: 17 December 2020

Auckland restrictions eased in steps,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has today set out a roadmap for Auckland to carefully move out of current Covid-19 restrictions.Alert Level 3 and 4 restrictions in Auckland have helped control the Delta outbreak over the past seven weeks while New Zealanders ramped up their vaccination rates.“Today, based on public health advice, Cabinet confirmed its plan to transition Auckland out of current restrictions carefully and methodically, with regular check-ins to ensure we’re continuing to actively control the virus,” Jacinda Ardern said.Step 1“From 11:59pm Tuesday, Auckland will remain in Alert Level 3 but several key changes will occur. People will be able to connect with loved ones OUTDOORS with no more than two households at a time, up to a maximum of 10 people; early childhood education will return for all; and people can move around Auckland for recreation such as beach visits and hunting.Step 2“At step two retail will open their doors, with the usual measures of wearing facemasks and keeping up physical distancing; public facilities such as pools and zoos will open; and the number of people who can meet OUTDOORS will increase to 25.Step 3“Step three will bring back those higher risk settings. Hospitality will open – seated, separated and with a limit of 50; close contact businesses like hairdressers will also open with mask use and physical distancing; and gatherings will also then extend to 50.“Cabinet will review each step weekly to ensure it’s safe to move before confirming the next step. The wage subsidy will continue to be available.“Public health advice also sets out that schools at this stage will be able to return after school holidays on the 18thof October with the final decision to be made on that closer to the time.“In total, this phasing amounts to a careful and methodical transition plan for Auckland. At the end of these steps, we will then move to a national framework that reflects a more highly vaccinated population, allowing us the ability to deal with riskier settings such as large-scale events with the use of vaccine certificates.“Cabinet also agreed the rest of New Zealand will remain at Alert Level 2 to continue to support Auckland to do the heavy lifting – but the 100 limit cap on hospitality venues is removed. The requirement for customers to be seated and separated with physical distancing remains in place.“Today we hit the milestone of 2 million New Zealanders vaccinated. It follows the doubling of Auckland vaccination rates over the past 7 weeks, with 84 percent of Aucklanders having had one dose, and 52 per cent now fully vaccinated. But there is more work to do.“Vaccines were always going to change the way we manage Covid-19 into the future, but our strategy has worked and will remain – we want to control the virus, avoid cases and hospitalisations, enjoy our freedoms, and reconnect with the world,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 4 October 2021

Successful funding for COVID_19 research round announced,"Researchers from across New Zealand have received funding to undertake research into the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and future pandemic responses.“Our response to COVID-19 has always been science led therefore it is crucial that we fund projects that give us insights into how whānau, communities and the health system responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout.“I am pleased to announce that 23 research projects involving staff from universities, Māori and Pacific research organisations, health and disability providers, Crown Research Institutes and Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand, were successful in their applications for funding.“Each project is being funded for 12 months and their research will explore the impacts of the pandemic on the population as a whole, as well as the specific experiences of Kaupapa Māori health providers, our Māori and Pacific communities, the disability sector, and people living rurally or in aged residential care.“Upon completion we expect the projects to have gathered important insights including how best to support the work of Kaupapa Māori health providers, tailor pandemic control for aged residential care facilities and improve our guidance about ventilation of spaces used by our most vulnerable communities.“This will give us insights into things such as long COVID, childhood immunisation and the pandemic’s overall impacts,” said Dr Ayesha Verrall.Each project was allocated funding of between $200,000 and $500,000. Funding comes from the COVID-19 health system response and the National Immunisation Programme.“The rigorous selection process is a good example of the reformed health system working together to set priorities and build on the evidence-based approach we have taken to the pandemic,” said Dr Ayesha Verrall.","Publication Date: 6 September 2022

APEC finance ministers and business leaders discuss COVID_19 recovery,"Finance ministers and business leaders from across the APEC region have connected to discuss the ongoing response to COVID-19.The Informal Ministerial Meeting with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council (ABAC) business leaders was hosted by the New Zealand Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson,who is Chair of the APEC Finance Ministers' Process for 2021.“Partnerships between government, business and civil society are critical to the region’s response to COVID-19 and will continue to play an important role in the longer-term recovery,” Grant Robertson said.“The attendees at today’s meeting discussed the importance of that recovery being sustainable and inclusive, and how economies and businesses can work together to achieve this goal.”“ABAC members also raised the importance of responding to the region’s environmental issues, particularly climate change.”ABAC Chair Rachel Taulelei also offered her reflections on the meeting.“ABAC is clear that addressing the continuing pandemic must be the top priority for APEC economies – overcoming the health crisis and using wide-spread vaccination and testing for safe and seamless re-opening of borders as a pre-requisite for economic recovery,” Rachel Taulelei said.“This informal dialogue, the first of its kind in an APEC year, has been the occasion for frank discussion with Finance Ministers about what has worked best during the crisis to support communities and business, especially SMEs, and what needs to guide us as we move into recovery mode.“Sustainability and inclusion are ongoing challenges, which need a stepped-up response in a region that needs to learn to live with Covid. Action to address climate change and other environmental risks are necessary for a healthy planet. Some people have already paid too high a price during the pandemic, including women, youth, Indigenous people, those living in rural areas and those without the skills required for an increasingly digital economy. Their well-being needs to be a priority as we move forward.“ABAC Members also emphasised the importance of trade and open markets – both to spread the availability of vaccines, essential health supplies and associated goods and services and to keep global supply chains moving. Trade is an enabler of a return to sustainable economic growth in the region.”The session was an innovation introduced for APEC 2021, making best use of the digital format to bring together people from across the region for an informal discussion.“This encouraged an open conversation between participants who might not otherwise have had an opportunity to come together during the APEC year. It enabled attendees to gain a deeper understanding of the issues affecting the region and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead,” Grant Robertson said.“The views of business leaders and the discussions at this meeting have been valuable and will feed into conversations between Ministers at the Finance Ministers’ Meeting in October.”","Publication Date: 25 June 2021

Shot in the arm for global vaccine development,"Government invests invaccine development to prevent future pandemics, save lives, and prevent economic damageThe Government is working to save lives and protect the economy from future pandemics by confirming New Zealand’s continued participation in an international coalition for vaccine research, announced Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods and RSI Associate Minister and Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall today.“We are protecting New Zealanders as the Covid-19 pandemic continues by pledging $10 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) over five years, to support its continued work to develop COVID-19 vaccines and to prepare for future pandemics,” says Megan Woods.“This renewed support will ensure our membership for the next five years. CEPI plays a critical role in supporting the global scientific community and it was a major contributor to the development of most of the vaccines available for COVID-19 today. New Zealand’s membership of CEPI, and the participation of our researchers and innovators in its networks significantly improves our ability to respond to this, and any future pandemic,” Megan Woods said.“Vaccines are the best tool to save lives and minimise the social, economic and cultural harms of this and future pandemics”, says Ayesha Verrall. “Widespread vaccination also reduces opportunities for new, more dangerous variants to arise, which would affect the most vulnerable in our communities. Through international collaboration, vaccines and innovations in vaccine technology and manufacturing can happen faster and more reliably.“CEPI has a vital role through the COVAX partnership in ensuring the international community has equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and other essential research and innovation. Supporting CEPI’s five-year plan, alongside our international partners, strengthens the global system for pandemic preparedness and response. New Zealand also provides active support to COVAX itself, contributing more than $26 million to date,” Ayesha Verrall said.CEPI’s five-year plan includes:being able to develop vaccines for any future pandemic within 100 days of the viral sequence being identified,developing pan-coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics that would apply across COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses, andestablish networks of global vaccine scientific and manufacturing capacity that can be rapidly utilised in any future pandemic.Associate Minister Ayesha Verrall announced New Zealand’s pledge at the CEPI replenishment summit.","Publication Date: 9 March 2022

Ministers sign off on use of first COVID_19 vaccine,"Cabinet has confirmed formal Government approval for use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.Following the provisional approval by Medsafe announced last week, formal Government approval for use represents another critical step in the process of ensuring the vaccine is safe and effective for New Zealanders.“The Government is continuing to go by the book and has carefully considered the ‘decision to use’ the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as part of our nationwide programme,” Chris Hipkins said.“Medsafe’s provisional approval was step one and ‘decision to use’ is a further greenlight on the road to our roll-out. After receiving further advice, Cabinet has endorsed officials’ advice to use Pfizer/BioNTech.“While we’ve found the ‘decision to use’ process around this first application to be relatively straightforward, the Government also recognise there will be a huge amount of further detail to consider as the other vaccines in our portfolio of 14.91 million courses go through the Medsafe approval process.“Now we’ve reached the crucial stage of approval for the first vaccine, we are in a much better position to start having a conversation with New Zealanders about how we plan to proceed, recognising the natural questions some will have. Information campaigns will start from next week to support this.“As part of our portfolio, we have secured up to 750,000 courses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine through an Advance Purchase Agreement, and we are seeking a further small allocation through the COVAX Facility.“When the first batch of vaccine arrives, we will be ready to go. We will start vaccinating our border workers within days of arrival and then the people they live with. People such as cleaners, the nurses who undertake health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, airline staff and hotel workers will be among the first to get the vaccine.”Chris Hipkins confirmed the vaccine has been assessed by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and has gained its approval for use here.“All these steps can provide further assurances to the New Zealand public that this vaccine is safe to use,” Chris Hipkins said.“While vaccination of our border and other frontline workers takes place, we will continue to receive advice from officials on the other vaccines in our portfolio. Medsafe is in regular conversations with AstraZeneca and Janssen and has begun engagement with Novavax. A similar rigorous approval process is being followed.“New Zealand continues to play a role internationally and specifically with the Pacific countries participating in the Polynesian Health Corridors programme. These countries, which include the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu, will be given access to the New Zealand vaccine portfolio.“There is still a long way to go but as a country we’ve made strong and significant progress against COVID-19 since it first emerged as a serious global threat about 12 months ago. The Government will leave nothing to chance to ensure that progress continues,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 10 February 2021

More minds focussed on reducing agricultural emissions,"Research into reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions is getting crucial support as part of Budget 22’s investment in the new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.“The sight of so many North Island communities working to recover from three major storms this year leaves us in no doubt of the need to take action on climate change. This investment is part of the Government’s significant effort to shift the dial and contribute to a global response to climate change, and to maintain a clear competitive edge internationally,” Damien O’Connor said.“Demand for tools and practices that reduce agricultural greenhouse gases is growing both in New Zealand and internationally. Research on our unique pasture-based farming systems is the gateway to meeting that demand.“We have to attract the best minds if we are to succeed. Success will be two-fold: it will see us meet our emissions targets as a sector, and open up significant export revenue for our IP.”Today’s announcement includes more than $9 million to support up to 15 PhD students and 12 post-doctoral students over six years, and the development of a national agricultural greenhouse gas capability plan to ensure we can meet the increased demand for researchers.The Government is also investing up to $350,000 to build on the current research programme into methane vaccines, which trigger antibodies that suppress methane in animals.“This funding will be used to test two alternative protein production systems and if successful, could help realise a vaccine as a real option for farmers,” Damien O’Connor said.“We are also investing $200,000 into further research on the effect plantain has on nitrous oxide emissions.“This will help us better understand the benefits of plantain and how it can be used on farm to reduce emissions.The latest investments will build on the $27 million announced last year as part of the launch of the Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions at Fieldays.The Centre focuses on reducing agriculture emissions through research and development. It is made up of the new Centre for Climate Action Joint Venture with industry and an enhanced New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre.“Customers abroad have increasing expectations on climate and sustainability. We’ve invested $339 million through the Centre to help our farmers reduce emissions. In getting this right, we can become the best farmers for the world,” Damien O’Connor said.For more information on the PhD and Fellowship programme go to ccaae.govt.nz","Publication Date: 1 March 2023

Auckland to move to Alert Level 1 at midday,"Auckland will move to COVID-19 Alert Level 1 at midday today, Friday 12 March.This follows six days of Auckland being at Level 2, with seven days prior to that at Level 3, after 15 positive community cases emerged outside managed isolation facilities.“Level 2 restrictions being in place until today have allowed us to get the results of day-12 testing for the last remaining contacts of case M, who are in isolation. These all came back negative overnight,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.“There are some remaining day-12 tests but these are for individuals already in a quarantine facility.“It also means we’ve now gone a full transmission cycle since the last exposure event where we were concerned people could have picked up the virus.“The Director-General of Health has advised Cabinet he considers the outbreak contained.“I know everyone in Auckland will be looking forward to a weekend with fewer restrictions, but we are asking that everyone keeps up the good habits that help us deal with cases if they emerge.

Pacific community reach vaccination milestone,"Pacific communities across the nation have rolled up their sleeves and played their part to reach a major vaccination milestone, 90 percent  have now had their first vaccination, Aupito William Sio, Minister for Pacific Peoples and Associate Minister of Health said.“Reaching this milestone reflects the work Pacific Health Providers and other community leaders have put in to reaching people in our Pacific communities across Aotearoa to support the vaccination drive, by door-knocking, going to workplaces and places of worship to vaccinate.“However, we still have work to do to reach those who are yet to receive their first dose, and also to encourage our communities to get their second dose, which will help us be able to get back to doing all the things we enjoy over the coming summer.“We know that giving Pacific people and Pacific Providers a say to lead in the delivery of vaccination services is what works for our communities.That innovative approach by Pacific providers using our Pacific language­ and cultural intelligence has been embraced by everyone,” said Aupito William Sio.Targeted initiatives have included pop-up vaccination events, community outreach activity, a special 0800 vaccine booking number staffed by Pacific language speakerstargeting Pacific families, and vaccination buses that are targeting areas where vaccination numbers are low and where communities have difficulty accessing services.“And, over the last year the Ministry of Health, in partnership with the Ministry of Pacific Peoples, has set up Pacific community roadshows and online fono across the country with the involvement of Pacific youth. These forums saw robust discussion about misinformation around the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine hesitancy in the community,” said Aupito William Sio.“We have also ensured that we have content in the nine Pacific languages on our Unite Against COVID-19 website, and targeted Pacific content in our communications campaigns.“The Ministry of Health has also commissioned research to better understand Pacific peoples’ attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccination, which helps to further refine our approach towards addressing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation amongst Pacific communities.“In the meantime, I encourage everyone in Aotearoa New Zealand who has had their first dose to book their second dose if they haven’t already, by visitingBookMyVaccine.nzor by calling Healthline.“We want all our communities to be protected against COVID-19,” said Aupito William Sio.","Publication Date: 24 November 2021

PM to chair APEC Informal Leaders_ Retreat on COVID_19,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will chair a virtual meeting of APEC Leaders on July 16 focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects.“This is the first time in APEC’s history that Leaders have held an additional meeting at Leaders’ level, and it reflects our desire to navigate together out of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis,” Jacinda Ardern said.“APEC economies have suffered their biggest contraction since the Second World War over the past year, with 81 million jobs lost. Responding collectively is vital to accelerate the economic recovery for the region.“Our region has already responded in significant ways, including removing barriers to the efficient distribution of vaccines and related goods, but there is still a lot of work to do to get through the crisis.“Leaders will share information so we can continue to build on our collective understanding of the region’s health response to COVID-19, and shape a collaborative economic response.“Containing COVID-19 through rapid, safe, and effective vaccination; micro- and macro-economic policy settings to sustain businesses and workers; and building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable economies will all be on the agenda.“I will be inviting discussion on immediate measures to achieve more co-ordinated regional action to assist recovery, as well as steps that will support inclusive and sustainable growth over the long term.“APEC Leaders will work together to get through the pandemic and promote a sustainable and inclusive recovery, because nobody is safe until everyone is safe,” Jacinda Ardern said.Leading a regional response to the pandemic is one of New Zealand’s highest priorities as APEC Chair. It has been the focus of recent meetings of Finance, Structural Reform and Trade Ministers, with all economies focused on international cooperation in responding to COVID-19 and laying the foundations for recovery.Editors’ Note:APEC is home to 2.9 billion people, represents 60 per cent of world GDP and 48 per cent of world trade (according to 2018 figures).New Zealand’s three policy priorities for APEC 2021 are shaped by the COVID-19 crisis and focused on bringing the region together to promote an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery.Economic and trade policies to strengthen recoveryThis priority focuses on APEC’s economic response to COVID-19. It aims to encourage trade and economic policies that support openness and connectivity, and reduce friction at the border in order to to reduce barriers and make it easier for companies to trade and do business throughout the APEC region.Increasing inclusion and sustainability for recoveryThis priority acknowledges the need for APEC’s long-term response to COVID-19 to be sustainable and inclusive of all people. It is about enhancing the participation of groups such as women and indigenous people in the economy, and ensuring their contributions are valued. It will also ensure the region’s recovery can be used to improve sustainability outcomes, including in the area of climate change.Pursuing innovation, and a digitally enabled recoveryThe priority focuses on APEC taking advantage of innovation in the digital space to improve the way business is done and make it more efficient and adaptable. It aims to encourage APEC members to embrace open and competitive markets for new technologies.There have been over 50 million cases of COVID-19 within APEC’s borders, with over one million deaths. The region has registered more than 100,000 new cases every day since November 2020 and, during this time, more than 22 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty.APEC-wide GDP contracted by 1.9 percent in 2020, the biggest fall since World War Two. While economic growth is recovering, around 81 million jobs have been lost due to the pandemic.","Publication Date: 12 July 2021

Tech ready for businesses and events to open up for summer,"Businesses and events will be set for summer, with the free NZ Pass Verifier app to scan and verify My Vaccine Passes now available to download, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said today.“New Zealand will move into the traffic light system (COVID-19 Protection Framework) from Friday 3 December, and the release of the NZ Pass Verifier app is another step for businesses and organisations to prepare for this next phase in our COVID response,” Chris Hipkins said.“The app helps give business certainty that they can quickly manage vaccine certificates and make sure they can easily check that their customers are all fully vaccinated.”The NZ Verifier app can be downloaded from the Apple and Google Play app stores today.“The app is ideal for any organisation that needs to verify customers’ vaccination status. Hospitality venues, close-contact businesses, large gatherings, events, air transport and gyms are just some of the types of businesses that will need to verify customer’s vaccination status if they wish to operate in higher risk levels under the COVID-19 Protection Framework.“For customers entering a business requiring proof of vaccination status, their My Vaccine Pass will be scanned by the verifier app. The verifier will show a green tick recognising the official QR code that is embedded into the customer’s pass.“It will show quickly that the person is fully vaccinated or has the appropriate exemption and can enter their premises. Importantly, the verifier app does not store a person’s data or see any information other than a person’s name and date of birth.“Technical guidancefor NZ Pass Verifier is available on the Ministry of Health website and additionalguidancefor businesses using the verifier under the COVID Protection Framework will be out later this week. People will also be able to call 0800 800606 for assistance.“Further work is being undertaken to accommodate events that expect large volumes of people at a time – such as stadiums, festivals, or large tourism operators.“Earlier this month, the Ministry published technical specifications for My Vaccine Pass and its verification. Some companies will integrate the technology into existing digital journeys or pre-verification ticketing processes.“Essential services such as supermarkets, access to health and disability services and primary and secondary education facilities cannot ask for proof of verification status and will not require a NZ Pass Verifier.“As My Vaccine Pass and its verification become part of everyday habits, we’re also asking people to keep using the tools we already have in place to protect us from COVID-19. Mask up, keep your distance and use your COVID Tracer app,” Chris Hipkins said.“Nearly 1.4 million My Vaccine Passes have been generated so far. For those who haven’t taken the step yet, we encourage you to do so.“This week we’re also publicising sector guidance for businesses to successfully transition to the traffic light system.”","Publication Date: 23 November 2021

He will travel to Te Anau, Invercargill, Queenstown, Arrowtown and Cromwell.“I would like to hear first-hand from local mayors and councillors, small businesses, employers, community organisations and iwi about how they are responding to the impact of closed borders,” Mr Nash said.“I also would like updates on the roll out of tourism support and infrastructure investment from the Tourism Recovery Package, Provincial Growth Fund and other sources.“I have been upfront that mass-scale international tourism is unlikely before 2022, but we are working hard to open a Trans-Tasman bubble as soon as we can in 2021.“We have never stopped working on the issue of the trans-Tasman bubble. Although we have had community cases here, and there have been community outbreaks in Australia which have slowed things down, the work has never stopped. We remain committed to it.“We are on-track to vaccinate the majority of Kiwis against COVID19 by the end of this year, after the deal to purchase extra doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Mass vaccination against COVID19 is a crucial step for our tourism industry and wider economy.“It reinforces our approach from the very beginning of the global pandemic, which was to emphasise a strong health response as the best economic response.“We responded immediately with a $400 million dollar support package for tourism last year. Wider support through wage subsidies, resurgence payments, and interest-free loans are also available.Background for EditorsEconomic support in Southland:Under theTourism Recovery Package, eleven tourism businesses in Fiordland, Stewart Island and Invercargill received $5.5million in cash grants, as well as multi-million dollar concessionary loan offers that are interest-free and don’t require repayment for two years. In addition, destination marketing agencies received $1.95 million to promote domestic tourism and events in Southland and Fiordland.*In infrastructure and regional economic development, approximately 47 Southland projects have received $90 million from theProvincial Development Unit(MBIE). This helps diversify regional economies that rely heavily on international tourism.Projects include big-ticket items, like:$22 million for the Milford Highway Fibre Connection$19.5 million for an inner-city regeneration project in Invercargill$8 million for a salmon hatchery at Bluff$1.9 million in forestry grants$500,000 for Invercargill airport terminal developmentThere are also a number of smaller projects under $0.5 million that nevertheless are important for community resilience and local pride, like restoration of community halls, war memorials, marae and churches.Economic support in Queenstown Lakes-Central Otago:Under the Tourism Recovery Package (TRG), 27 businesses in the Otago region, most of them around the Lakes, received $17.46million in cash grants. Separate multi-million dollar concessionary loan offers are interest-free and don’t need repayment for two years. In addition, destination marketing agencies received a further $2.4million to promote domestic tourism and events in Queenstown, Wanaka, and Central Otago.*Outside the TRG, approximately 60 infrastructure and regional economic development projects in Otago are receiving $98 million from theProvincial Development Unit(MBIE). This will help diversify regional economies and create new jobs.Infrastructure projects include:$6.5million for the Clutha Gold Cycle Trail$2million for seismic strengthening of the Lakes District Museum at Arrowtown$1.2million to upgrade community halls in the Queenstown Lakes District$8million for upgrades to the SH6/SH8b intersection at Cromwell* Tourism businesses supported inSouthlandare: Doubtful Sound Cruises; Fiordland Expeditions; JUCY Cruise; Milford Sound Tourism; Real Journeys Milford Sound; Stewart Island Ferry Service; Te Anau Glowworm Caves; Te Anau Helicopter Services; Transport World; Air Milford; Southern Discoveries.Tourism businesses supported in the Lakes and Central Otago districtsinclude: TSS Earnslaw and Walter Peak; Cardrona and Treble Cone; Puzzling World; Ziptrek Ecotours; AJ Hackett; Outback NZ Nomad Safaris; Dart River Safaris; KJet; Wilkin River Jets; Wanaka River Journeys; Skyline Queenstown; Highlands Motorsport Park; Skydive Queenstown; Over the Top; True South Flights; Glenorchy Air; Alpine Helicopters; Southern Alps Air; Backcountry Helicopters;Marketing and economic development agenciesare: Destination Fiordland; Great South; Southern Lakes Marketing Alliance; Lake Wanaka Tourism; Destination Queenstown; Central Otago District Council.","Publication Date: 17 March 2021

Third COVID_19 vaccine receives provisional approval,"New Zealand’s regulatory authority Medsafe has granted provisional approval of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 18 years of age and older, Acting Minister for COVID-19 Response Dr Ayesha Verrall announced today.New Zealand secured 7.6 million doses (enough for 3.8 million people) of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine through an advance purchase agreement with the company last year.“The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is one of four purchase agreements we have with pharmaceutical companies for COVID-19 vaccines. We took a portfolio approach to manage the risk that some vaccines might not complete trials or be approved for use in New Zealand,” Dr Ayesha Verrall said.“We are in a fortunate position to now have three vaccines receive provisional approval. Cabinet is yet to consider whether to use the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in New Zealand.“However this is an important step towards enabling the donation of AstraZeneca from New Zealand to Pacific countries, where we have made commitments.”The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine requires two doses and is stored at normal fridge temperatures (2 to 8 degrees Celsius). The first delivery could be as early as late August, and officials are working closely with AstraZeneca to confirm delivery schedules.“Our immunisation plan in New Zealand remains focused on rolling out the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The workforce is ramping up in line with increased deliveries.“We are on track to provide two doses of the Pfizer vaccines to everyone in New Zealand who wishes to have one, by the end of this year. No one will miss out,” Dr Ayesha Verrall said.","Publication Date: 29 July 2021

Booster vaccine available from end of November,"Booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine will start being administered from 29 November, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“Medsafe has already approved use of Pfizer as a booster for people who are 18 years or older,” Chris Hipkins said.“Following further advice to Cabinet from the vaccine technical advisory group, today I’m announcing that the vaccination programme will start administering booster doses from 29 November.“Vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19. Booster doses will be available free for anyone in New Zealand aged 18 or older who has completed their two dose course more than six months ago.“And, people will be able to access boosters in New Zealand, whether they received their earlier doses here or overseas.“I’m also confirming that the Pfizer vaccine will be used for boosters, regardless of which vaccine was used for earlier doses. It’s the same Pfizer vaccine used for the first two doses in the vaccination rollout.“While most other countries are rationing boosters to certain groups, we have made the decision to make boosters available to everyone. That ensures simplicity and equity.“People are eligible to take up the offer of a booster once six months have passed since their second dose, but there’s no need to rush to get the booster. The science shows fully vaccinated people remain really well protected from infection, and from being seriously ill if they do get COVID-19.“Our healthcare and border workers are a priority group for booster vaccine doses because they’re on the front line against COVID-19 and because large numbers of them completed their vaccine course six months or longer ago. We will also be making sure older people including people in residential care have good access to booster doses when they become eligible.“We’re particularly keen to make sure those groups are aware that the booster programme is about to kick off, and that they’re eligible.“There are currently 144,000 people in New Zealand who have been vaccinated for six months and 455,847 who will be by the end of the year.”Chris Hipkins added that New Zealanders topping up their personal armour against COVID-19 with one of the most highly effective vaccines available has another benefit. It will also support the Protection Framework when this replaces the Alert Level system.“Combining the Protection Framework with the booster programme will reduce the risk of severe disease caused by COVID-19, reduce the burden on hospitals and other healthcare providers, and protect those at high occupational risk of exposure.“And it will give us even greater confidence that, as we transition to a world where we’re freer to move, live and work with less disruption, we can remain protected from Delta.“Of course, we also need to remember to keep on with the other simple steps for staying safe, such as distancing, using face coverings, scanning and staying at home if sick.“I also want to stress that while the booster programme is an exciting next step in our pandemic response, increasingthe vaccination coverage of first and second doses, particularly for Māori and Pacific people, remains the Government’s number one priority in our nationwide vaccination rollout.“Pleaseencourage your whānau and friends to get vaccinated.”Key points:Vaccination clinics, pharmacies and GPs will provide booster doses from the end of November.You will be able use thebook my vaccine websiteto book a free booster vaccine dose from 26 November.Boosters are strongly recommended for anyone who has had their second dose at least six months ago.Booster doses are not currently required for the public to get a vaccine certificate for access to events, gyms, churches, hairdressers, and other services and premises.For people who are immuno-suppressed and receiving a third dose of Pfizer as part of their primary vaccinations, they will need to wait at least six months after the third dose.","Publication Date: 15 November 2021

Ethnic Communities get vaccination funding boost,"A new Vaccine Uptake Fund to provide support for activities aimed at increasing vaccination in our harder-to-reach ethnic communitiesEthnic Communities Communications Fund doubled to support 71 initiatives aimed at boosting vaccination rates by eliminating the barriers and countering misinformation faced by our ethnic communitiesA new Vaccine Uptake Fund to support COVID-19 vaccination among ethnic communities will help further increase vaccinations across Aotearoa, Minister for Diversity, Inclusion and Ethnic Communities Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.“I am delighted to see our ethnic communities continuing to play their part in getting New Zealand vaccinated against COVID-19. We can further support them to connect with those harder to reach people, while removing barriers to vaccination that exist,”Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.“Communities have told us that being able to provide things like transport, interpreters, collateral and venue hire would make a real difference. This new Vaccine Uptake Fund will pay for this sort of activity and make it easier for people to get vaccinated.”The new $1 million Vaccine Uptake Fund is in addition to the$2 million for theEthnic Communities Communications Fundwhich supported 71 initiatives across a broad range of communities throughout the country.“The Ethnic Communities Communications Fund had a huge response, and as a result the funding was doubled from $1 million to $2 million to help boost vaccination rates among our ethnic communities,”Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.Successful initiatives focused on translation services, educational and community wellbeing. The initiatives will support doctors, medical professionals, respected community, youth, and faith-based leaders from a range of ethnic communities to engage through online community health forums, educational workshops, videos, and social media platforms focused on the vaccination journey.Misinformation about vaccines from other countries is an issue for some ethnic communities and will be addressed through initiatives using community forums, videos, social media platforms and radio broadcasts.“New Zealand is a diverse country with over 213 ethnic communities represented who collectively speak over 160 languages, have varied needs, and may access information differently,” Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.“Ethnic community organisations understand these diverse needs and are best placed to reach those who need a little additional support to get vaccinated. These two funds are and will continue to support them to be able to do this effectively.“I encourage all community organisations who require further support to get vaccination rates as high as possible within our ethnic communities to make an application to the Vaccine Uptake Fund.”Funding for both funds has been provided by the Ministry of Health and was set up in partnership with the Ministry for Ethnic Communities. Community organisations and individuals can apply for funding now at theMinistry for Ethnic Communities website.","Publication Date: 28 October 2021

Changes to isolation to reflect vaccination status,"People who are fully vaccinated will now spend less time isolating if they get COVID-19 or are a close contact of a case.Contact tracing categories have changed to reflect the vaccination status of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the community, and others who may have been exposed to them.The isolation period for fully vaccinated COVID-19 cases in the community has been reduced from 14 days to 10 days, and must include 72 hours symptom-free.The isolation period for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated COVID-19 cases will remain 14 days, including 72 hours symptom-free.“If you are vaccinated and catch COVID-19, by day 10 of infection you will pose a very low risk of passing on the virus - and do not need to isolate for as long as someone who’s unvaccinated,” Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said.“That’s because the amount of viral, genetic material declines faster in fully vaccinated people.“Vaccination also helps prevent a person with COVID-19 from becoming seriously ill and reduces the likelihood they’ll end up in hospital. It is the greatest protection we have against the virus.”Under the changes, household contacts of a COVID-19 case will self-isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status, because this group is at highest risk of contracting the virus.“This change reflects the different transmission dynamic of the Delta variant,” Ayesha Verrall said.Close contacts who are fully vaccinated need to self-isolate for 7 days.Close contacts who are partially vaccinated or not vaccinated need to self-isolate for 10 days.To be fully vaccinated, it needs to be 7 days or more since you had your second dose of the vaccine.The other change announced today is the tightening of use of the casual plus contact category, to a narrow range of circumstances. There is very little evidence of transmission in this category, with preliminary data showing only 0.1 percent of casual plus interactions resulted in infections.“Keeping the contact tracing categories as they were would have resulted in some people being identified as contacts when the data now tells us they’re at very, very low risk,” Ayesha Verrall said.Information about the changes to the contact tracing categories can be found on the Ministry of Health website.","Publication Date: 16 November 2021

Government guarantees free vaccines for every New Zealander,"The Government has invested $1.4 billion in New Zealand’s COVID-19 vaccination programme to ensure every New Zealander can receive a free vaccination, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.The Government has today confirmed for the first time the amount of money it has allocated over two years for vaccines and the vaccination programme.“The COVID-19 vaccination programme is key to securing our economic recovery,” Chris Hipkins said.“New Zealand will continue to face uncertainties over the coming year as COVID-19 spreads and evolves globally, and it’s critical we keep investing in our health response to keep New Zealanders safe.“Effective and ongoing vaccination of the community will also unlock economic opportunities and allow us to safely reopen our borders over time.“Our health response has been strong and successful so far, but we’re taking nothing for granted. Setting aside $1.4 billion for vaccines and infrastructure means New Zealand is well-placed to meet our COVID-19 challenges head on.“Of this, more than $1 billion has been allocated for purchasing vaccines and specialist equipment. $964.3 million is for manufacturer advance purchase agreements and the COVAX facility to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. $66.3 million is for specialist vaccine equipment, including purchase of syringes and related vaccine storage facilities and transport.“We have secured sufficient doses to vaccinate everyone in New Zealand for free and to also support our Pacific neighbours. Additional vaccines deemed safe and effective can be deferred for later use and further donated to support regional recovery.“The remaining $356.9 million has been allocated for technology to support the roll-out, funding for DHBs, ongoing support for Medsafe, and to stand up community immunisation centres.“This is a massive investment to continue support for what is the biggest single undertaking the health system has ever faced.“In addition to the $1.4 billion, $30 million has gone into vaccine research and the potential for domestic manufacturing and $75 million for Official Development Assistance funding to support Pacific and global vaccine access.“We’re closely monitoring the programme to ensure it’s as effective and efficient as it can be and so we can prepare to support annual immunisation programmes in future to maintain the ground we have gained,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 19 May 2021

Mr. Burgess is currently serving as New Zealand’s Ambassador to Ireland.“Virtual engagements have served us very well over the last year, but I’m very much looking forward to face to face engagement,” Damien O’Connor said.“Being able to meet with my counterparts – albeit socially distanced – will help us move towards concluding high quality, comprehensive and inclusive FTAs.”United Kingdom legIn London, Damien O’Connor is scheduled to meet with his trade counterpart, Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss. This follows their agreement last month to accelerate FTA negotiations between the two nations.He is also expected to meet with Minister of State in the Cabinet Office Lord Frost to discuss New Zealand’s trade access interests post-Brexit.As Minister of Agriculture, Damien O’Connor will be meeting with George Eustice, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Minister is also expected to have engagements with industry representatives and New Zealand stakeholders in the UK, relevant to both his agriculture and trade portfolios.“New Zealand enjoys a uniquely close bond with the UK through our shared history.“The relationship is underpinned by wide family, cultural, business and sporting linkages. I can’t think of a stronger foundation on which to build a great free trade agreement.“I see a quality FTA with the UK, negotiated in line with Government’s ‘Trade for All’ agenda, as galvanising these ties through trade and investment.”Brussels legThe priority in Brussels is adding further momentum to the EU-New Zealand FTA negotiations.“I’m really looking forward to sitting down with key figures in the European Commission at this important stage in our FTA talks, notably my Trade Commissioner counterpart, Valdis Dombrovskis, and Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski.”While in Brussels, the Minister is also expected to meet with key Parliamentary and industry representatives, as well as the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sophie Wilmès.“The EU and New Zealand are strong partners and good friends. It is a real anomaly that we don’t already have a free trade agreement with a partner with whom we share so many values and interests.”Paris legIn Paris, Damien O’Connor is scheduled to meet with his counterpart Frank Riester, Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness.“The New Zealand – France relationship has gone from strength to strength under this Government, not least with our successful joint leadership in recent times of the Christchurch Call.“In Paris, I will be reinforcing the case for the EU-NZ FTA with one of our most important partners in Europe. There is no better partner for France than New Zealand with respect to trade and sustainable development and an FTA will be in both our strategic as well as long term, diversified economic interests.”Singapore en routeOn the way to Europe, Damien O’Connor will stop in Singapore for meetings with Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Trade and Industry, as well as Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, in support of New Zealand’s export-led recovery from COVID-19.“The short visit to Singapore provides the opportunity to engage with one of our most trusted, reliable, and long-standing partners in the region. We share many areas of interest, including APEC 2021, which New Zealand is currently hosting.”In all locations, the Minister will comply with host government COVID-19 restrictions and testing requirements. He will also undertake 14 days of MIQ upon return to New Zealand in late June.The Minister and his small travelling delegation have been vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to the trip.“COVID-19 is teaching us all a lesson in the value of relationships and international cooperation. You only have to look at vaccine supply chains to see just how interconnected our collective fortunes are. Trade is a positive and stabilising force for the world,” Damien O’Connor said.","Publication Date: 12 June 2021

Over half of border workforce receive first vaccinations,"More than half of New Zealand’s estimated 12,000 border workforce have now received their first vaccinations, as a third batch of vaccines arrive in the country, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.As of midnight Tuesday, a total of 9,431 people had received their first doses. More than 70 percent of those, which equates to 6,688 people, have been delivered in the Auckland region.“We are well on our way to ensuring those who are most at risk of COVID-19, the cleaners, nurses who carry out health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, hotel workers, airline staff, port authorities and vaccinators will be protected from this virus,” Chris Hipkins said.“I’m also pleased to confirm that a third shipment of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines arrived safely yesterday afternoon, which adds a further 65,500 doses, bringing the total number of COVID-19 vaccines in New Zealand to 200,000.“From here, we plan to ramp up the vaccination programme, as we move to vaccinate border worker’s families and household contacts. We will then move on to front line health and emergency staff – those people who may be exposed to COVID-19 while doing their jobs.”Border worker’s families and household contacts will start to be vaccinated in earnest next week, but in some smaller regions, district health boards have already been able to expand their programmes to include these groups.“In places like Nelson/Marlborough, the smaller workforce has meant both the border workers and their families have been vaccinated at the same time, with the same batch of doses. This is really good news as it means they will also be protected from the virus, and ahead of schedule.“I look forward to this rolling out in our main centres from next week.”","Publication Date: 3 March 2021

Flu vaccine to protect Kiwis this winter,"From today, 1.8 million flu vaccines are available to help protect New Zealanders from winter illness, Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall has announced.“Vaccination against flu is safe and will be a first line of defence against severe illness this winter,” Dr Verrall said.“We can all play a part in preventing illness that send people to hospital, so I’m getting my flu shot today, and urge others to do the same.“Every winter, our hospitals and thewiderhealthcare system see an increase in pressure,particularly aroundadmissions for respiratory infections and other illnesses.“Last year we saw a combination of COVID and the flu adding to the strain on our hospitals. This year we can help avoid that by getting boosted against COVID and getting a flu jab as well.“We know flu can be a particularly serious disease for people with weakened immunity, and around 500 New Zealanders die from the flu annually. The flu vaccine reduces the likelihood of ending up in hospital if you get sick this winter.“The flu vaccine is free for people aged 65 years and over, Māori and Pacific people aged 55 years and over, pregnant people, and people who have long-term conditions like diabetes, asthma, or heart conditions, children aged 6 months to 12 years old, and people with mental health and addiction issues.“For many of us, our social lives are now back to what they were pre-Covid so it’s really important to get immunised to help slow the peak of flu season and protect ourselves and our communities,” Dr Verrall said.From today, an additional Covid-19 bivalent booster is also available, meaning in many cases people will be able to get their flu and Covid booster shots at the same time.Book your flu and COVID-19 vaccines now atwww.BookMyVaccine.co.nz,call Healthline on 0800 28 29 26, or contact your GP, pharmacy or healthcare provider.“All New Zealanders over 30 and over can access the booster as long as it’s been at least 6 months since their last COVID-19 booster or positive COVID-19 test,” Dr Verrall said.“People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 will also be able to receive an additional booster, regardless of how many doses they’ve previously had.“While we know vaccinations will be hugely important in ensuring people stay well and out of hospital, if people do get sick we also want to make sure they have a range of options to access health advice and care in their community,wherever they are.“You can get clinical advice from Healthline, your local doctor who may also be able to see you via telehealth, your pharmacy or your local health provider. In key areas of the country Accident and Medical clinics will be open longer, relieving pressure on EDs.“We can all play a part in staying well this winter,” Dr Verrall said.","Publication Date: 1 April 2023

That in turn has led to an increase in hospital occupancy.“We are continuing to ask New Zealanders to do three things - get vaccinated, wear a mask in many or most indoor settings and isolate when sick to suppress the spread of the virus over the remaining winter months. If we all play our part we can take some pressure off the health system.“To support this we are implementing a range of measures to help Kiwis stay well. These extra measures will help get us and the health system through the winter months. Please do your bit.Medicines“We are increasing access to antiviral medication to those most likely to end up in hospital, making free masks and RATs more widely available and doing another push to lift uptake of flu and COVID-19 vaccines including the second booster.""Antiviral medications can reduce the seriousness of COVID-19 meaning fewer people need to be hospitalised, so we are making these more widely available as pharmacist only medications.“Pharmac are also broadening the eligibility criteria to enable more people from higher risk groups to access antiviral medications. Pharmac will be making further announcements about this today.“These eligible groups will be able to access antivirals without the need for a doctor’s prescription. This means access will expand from 2 per cent to 10 per cent of cases.“From Monday 18 July anyone over 75 years of age who has tested positive for COVID-19 or anyone who has been admitted previously to an Intensive Care Unit directly as a result of COVID-19, will be eligible to access antivirals through their GP.“This will help alleviate pressure on primary care by removing the need for GPs to review every COVID-19 patient that may be eligible for antivirals.“To speed up access to antivirals, GPs can now provide back pocket prescriptionswhichmeans at-risk patients for acute respiratory illnesses can be preapproved and have their prescription ready should they become unwell and need the medicine immediately.RATs and masks“To increase uptake in use in RATs and masks packs of medical masks will be provided free along with free RAT kits for individuals and households from testing centres and in more locations by the end of the week. You do not need to have COVID-19 symptoms. And P2/N95 masks will be available for clinically vulnerable and high risk individuals.“Free RATs will be available from all current community providers, including marae, testing stations and local pharmacies.“We are encouraging everyone who needs extra RATs or masks to head to a testing site or other location and collect a free pack for you and your whānau. There is no criteria, you don’t need to be unwell or have symptoms.“Wearing masks can reduce new cases of the virus by as much as 53 per cent. We are asking New Zealanders to keep up good mask wearing, especially over the remaining winter months where the virus is more likely to pass in indoor settings.“The tried and tested measures: wearing a high quality mask, strong vaccine and booster uptake, antivirals and testing are highly effective and will put us in the best position to get through what is one of the toughest winters we’ve faced.“We are also providing 10 million child-size masks available for year 4-7 students in New Zealand and up to 30,000 masks a week for all other students and school staff, alongside extra funding to support better ventilation over winter.“These are the most effective measures we have. They are simple but if we all do them we can lessen illness and the burden on our health system and dedicated health workers, and get through this darkest part of winter,” Dr Verrall said.Notes to editors:Over the past 2 months:10.4 million RATs have been distributed.16 million medical procedure masks (7.9 million of these have been distributed through community providers)Over 3 million N95s (over 167,000 of these via community groups to high risk or vulnerable people).The Ministry of Health currently have on hand 46.6 million RATs, 41 million medical procedure masks, and 5.1 million N95s for community use, with good supply chains in place to meet increased demand as people protect themselves and others this winter.","Publication Date: 14 July 2022

Preserve your language and culture, to enhance spiritual and physical wellbeing,” said Aupito William Sio.‘Tapui’ emphasises the need to care for and nurture the Tokelau Language and culture to ensure its growth and prosperity.“They have also embraced, for the second year running, the opportunities presented by celebrating Te Gagana o Tokelau – the Tokelau language – online, in order to keep people safe from Covid 19.“There’s a traditional saying in Tokelau culture, “ko na alofivae e hē mātutu”, that means in English ‘the soles of our feet are never dry’ – our work is never done, we must keep persevering.“I know this spirit of resilience, embodied in the Kanava wood so beloved of Tokelau’s carvers, will ensure that the language and culture of Tokelau are preserved, raising  the spiritual and physical wellbeing of our Tokelau people, be they here in Aotearoa or back on the beautiful atolls of Tokelau.”Tokelau’s three coral atolls,Atafu, Fakaofo and Nukunonu, cover a total land area of just 12 square kilometres.The most recent census records 8,676 Tokelauans living in Aotearoa, almost half of those in the Whanganui-a-Tara region. This year marks 73 years since Tokelau became part of the New Zealand realm.“Take the time this year to join Tokelauans across the motu in celebrating Tokelau Language Week with a variety of online activities. Even learning a greeting or two can be the window into Tokelau’s cultural traditions, as well as a chance to meet new people, with fresh perspectives,” said Aupito William Sio.Editor’s Note :Tokelau Language Week has been celebrated since 2012 as part of the Ministry for Pacific Peoples’ Pacific Language Weeks programme and is the ninth and final language week to be celebrated this year.The Language Week will run from 4 pm on Sunday 24 October to Saturday 30 October and is being launched online byMafutaga Tokelau I Manawatuvia the official Tokelau Language Week 2021https://www.facebook.com/nztokelaulanguageweek/.Further information and language resources on Tokelau Language Week can be found on the Ministry for Pacific Peoples websitehttps://www.mpp.govt.nz/programmes/pacific-language-weeks/tokelau-language-week-2021/.","Publication Date: 24 October 2021

Northland to move to Alert Level 3 tonight,"Northland will move to Alert Level 3 restrictions from 11:59pm tonight following recent information on the risk presented by the positive case initially tested in Whangarei earlier this week and confirmed in Auckland yesterday, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said.The person is now in an Auckland Managed Isolation Quarantine facility.“Updated information provided by the police today shows the case moved extensively around Northland after travelling there on 2 October,” Chris Hipkins said.“We believe this new information warrants an alert level change decision to keep Northland people safe.“We recognise that it is unusual to put a region into Alert Level 3 when there are no further cases. However it’s vitally important that we get ahead of any potential spread, and set up widespread testing and continue contact tracing efforts.“Restrictions will remain in place until 11.59pm Tuesday and will be reviewed at Cabinet on Monday.“This is a strict Level 3 and as with Waikato, the easing steps announced for Auckland earlier this week will not apply to Northland.“The Auckland boundary will stay in place.“A public health investigation continues to identify close contacts and any potential locations of interest.“The information we have at this stage is that the person was in Northland from the afternoon of 2 October until the evening of 6 October. They are believe to have travelled around the region, including in Whangarei, Kamo, Paihia and Kawakawa, before returning to Auckland.“Widespread testing and wastewater testing will take place over the weekend.“Every Northlander needs to stay home, get tested as soon as possible if they have symptoms, and continue to check the Ministry of Health website for updated locations of interest. And of course vaccination centres continue to be open in Alert Level 3.“We know many people in Northland live rurally, but the advice is the same for everyone – get vaccinated, get tested, and follow the Alert Level 3 requirements.“As we have seen in Waikato the virus is finding its way into rural areas and finding unvaccinated people. Distance is no barrier.”“It’s never been more urgent to get vaccinated and we urge everyone to act now – don’t wait. Information on vaccine centres is available on the HealthPoint website.”Locations of interest, testing and vaccinationThe first locations of interest for Northland have been added to the Ministry of Health’s website.They are the BP Connect Wylies petrol station at 49 Maunu Road, Woodhill, Whangarei from 11.20pm on 2 October to 12.20am 3 October. And the Z Kensington service station, corner of Kamo Road and Nixon Street, Whangarei from 3.45pm-4.45pm on 4 October.Testing centres operating in the Northland region are at Kaitaia Hospital; 1 Sammaree Place in Kerikeri, Dargaville Hospital; 20 Winger Crescent in Kamo; and Pohe Island in Whangarei.","Publication Date: 8 October 2021

New fund to empower Pacific Peoples to navigate COVID_19_s protection framework,"A new fund will support the empowerment of Pacific Aotearoa to live safely under New Zealand’s COVID-19 Protection Framework, said Minister for Pacific Peoples, Aupito William Sio.In November, Cabinet agreed on $2 million in funding for the Ministry for Pacific Peoples to support outreach into the Pacific Community. This will underpin their safe transition to the COVID-19 Protection Framework.“This investment will ensure the shift to the COVID-19 Protection Framework is well communicated and understood by our Pacific communities.“From now until June 2022, MPP will engage with our communities throughout Aotearoa supporting an educational empowerment approach to Pacific peoples. I want them to have the confidence and independence to navigate safely their movements under the new framework in the languages the different Pacific nations understand,” Aupito William Sio said.The COVID-19 Protection Framework replaces the elimination strategy and former alert level system.“This transition to the COVID-19 Protection Framework is supported by our vaccination rates reaching 90 percent to minimise the spread of COVID-19. I am delighted that 92 percent of Pacific people, eligible to receive the vaccine, had received their first dose.“Delivery of the Pacific Aotearoa Community Outreach fund will enable the Ministry to determine where support and assistance is required and guide that response – such as investing in workshops to keep communities safe; initiatives to encourage Pacific people to get fully vaccinated; and programmes to remove barriers hindering Pacific communities.“This will include access to digital devices, to enable greater awareness and access to online information.“I expect this to reach over 1,000 Pacific peoples nationally, and create 50 targeted initiatives and pilots, The Pacific Aotearoa Community Outreach fund will ensure our people are supported to transition and live safely in the new framework,” Aupito William Sio said.","Publication Date: 8 December 2021

NZ commits further economic support to Pacific,"Foreign Affairs Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has confirmed Aotearoa New Zealand is providing further economic support to the Pacific to strengthen economic resilience in response to the impact of COVID-19.“The Pacific region is our home and there are so many links that have shaped Aotearoa New Zealand. Our economic interests are also intertwined and we must continue to create mutual opportunities with our neighbours,” said Nanaia Mahuta.“The whole region has felt the economic impact of COVID-19, especially on our tourism and hospitality sectors. Businesses, workers and communities across the Pacific will take some time to recover and rebuild.“Aotearoa New Zealand is committed to keep working in partnership with Pacific nations on economic resilience. I am pleased to confirm that up to NZ$75 million in additional economic support is provided in Budget 2022.“This contingency funding can be drawn-down to continue economic support for Pacific countries should the need arise in 2022/23.“Budget support is in line with Aotearoa New Zealand’sPacific Resilience Approachand demonstrates our respect for the sovereignty of Pacific countries. It has helped countries maintain core services and step-up their health responses in the face of reduced revenues due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.“The extra NZ$75 million contingency support is in addition to approximately NZ$325 million already provided for emergency budget support to countries impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19.“While the Pacific is expected to return to growth in 2022, the recovery is likely to be slower than initially forecast. Many Pacific countries remain in the midst of their first COVID-19 outbreaks. A number still have tight border controls and other restrictions still in place.“Due to the scale of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, the implications of ongoing supply chain disruptions, and a degree of uncertainty around international travel, it is likely to take several years before Pacific economies return to pre-pandemic levels.“Our support through the pandemic has also seen us donate and fund with partners more than 1.349 million doses of vaccine to the Pacific. We have also provided PPE equipment and deepened our people partnerships with training and workforce development, in order to support vaccination programmes and laboratory infrastructure.“In addition to health and vaccine support, New Zealand is also supporting other initiatives that contribute to economic resilience. These include improved access to advice and finance for small-medium businesses in the Cook Islands and supporting Fiji to implement reforms to improve the business and investment climate.“The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented economic impact on the region and so New Zealand’s response has adjusted for these fiscal risks. Even as borders begin to reopen, Pacific countries will require additional financing to move back onto a resilience path.“New Zealand has for many years worked with a number of Pacific countries on economic reform including the provision of budget support. This will continue as the wider region recovers and rebuilds,” said Nanaia Mahuta.","Publication Date: 3 June 2022

Post_peak plan a safe return to greater normality,"Traffic light system remains in place, but is significantly simplified.Post peak (from 4 April) vaccine pass requirements are removed and become optionalPost peak (from 4 April)  vaccine mandates are narrowed to health and disability, aged care, corrections and border workforcesEvidence based changes to traffic light system take effect from this weekend and include:At Red Indoor capacity limits increase from 100 to 200, and outdoor capacity limits removedOutdoor face mask requirements removedAdditional mask requirements for workers at indoor events at OrangeQR code scanning requirements removedNew Zealand’s successful management of the Omicron outbreak and high rates of vaccination mean it’s now safe to ease the restrictions that have successfully prevented widespread health and economic damage, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.“The evidence shows we are coming off the Omicron peak with cases in Auckland having already declined significantly, and a decline expected nationally by early April,” Jacinda Ardern said.“To date we’ve had more than 500,000 reported cases of COVID-19 and expert modellers say there have probably been 1.7 million actual infections. That figure, coupled with 95 percent of New Zealanders being fully vaccinated, means we now have a high level of collective immunity.“New Zealanders have worked incredibly hard to get through this pandemic and as a result of those efforts we are now in a position to move forward and change the way we do things.“First up we have simplified the COVID-19 Protection Framework to target restrictions at those activities that reduce transmission the most.“From 4 April, My Vaccine Pass will no longer be required by the Government meaning Kiwis will no longer have to be vaccinated in order to enter those venues covered by the Pass.“We recognise that some businesses, events or venues may still choose to use vaccine passes, so we will maintain the infrastructure for them.“From 4 April, vaccine mandates will be removed, except for health and disability, aged care, corrections and border workforces.“Like many other countries we are retaining a small number of mandates targeted at keeping our COVID-19 frontline staff safe and to ensure our most vulnerable, like those in aged care facilities or those with disabilities, are protected from the virus.“I know for many this part of our defence against COVID-19 was one of the hardest. But mandates meant we reached the levels of vaccination needed to prevent the devastating outbreaks seen across the world.“We’ve also used the evidence gathered over the last few months on Omicron to make changes to the Red and Orange settings.“From midnight this Friday outdoor gathering limits will be lifted. We know being outdoors for gatherings is safe. We want to encourage that, especially at Red.“We also believe we can lift indoor gathering limits at Red with little material impact on hospitalisations, so these will double from 100 to 200.“Orange settings remain broadly the same with no gathering limits but extra guidance on holding safe events, and a new requirement for workers to wear masks at indoor events.“And so, simply put, Red means indoor gathering limits and masks, Orange means masks, and Green means guidance.“At all levels, the testing and isolation requirements remain as they are now.“We are keeping the traffic light framework in order to offer ongoing protections in the event of a new variant or in cases of future surges, but our plan is to move down to Orange and then ultimately Green once it is safe to do so.“Putting people’s health first is the best economic approach. The hard work and sacrifices of New Zealanders delivered the lowest numbers of cases and deaths in the OECD for the last two years and puts us in the best position to recover strongly.“With our cases coming down it’s time to take our next steps with confidence in the collective immunity and protections we have built up. These new settings support greater economic activity and get everyone closer to feeling a bit more normal, while also continuing to manage COVID-19 and provide protection and care for those who need it most.“With our economy now larger than pre-COVID levels, record low levels of unemployment, and tourism about to reopen we are in a strong position to accelerate our recovery. Our COVID-19 restrictions have been tough, but they have delivered a strong foundation for us to move forward,” Jacinda Ardern said.Further information is on theUnite against COVID-19 website","Publication Date: 23 March 2022

COVID_19 milestone_ 5000th vaccinator completes specialised training,"A significant COVID-19 workforce milestone has been reached, with the 5000thvaccinator completing specialised training to administer the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“A huge amount of work has been going on behind the scenes to boost numbers of trained vaccinators and this is a milestone worth celebrating,” Chris Hipkins said. “This specialised online training has been vitally important in ensuring we have sufficient workforce ready as we continue to ramp-up our COVID-19 vaccine rollout.“The Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) started running the training for the Pfizer vaccine in February and as of this week, we’ve had 5,358 vaccinators who’ve completed the programme.“So far, almost 2,000 vaccinators have been involved in actively immunising people since the COVID-19 vaccine rollout started nearly three months ago.“Our dedicated vaccinators - nurses, doctors, pharmacists and those in other approved vaccinating professions - are working extremely hard to protect New Zealanders against this virus as our rollout expands into Group 3, and I want to thank them for their vital contribution.“It’s important to remember that the most significant roll-out won’t begin until July when we start vaccinating the general public so we’re preparing our vaccination workforce with that timeline in mind.“Current modelling indicates we’ll need around 1,600 full-time equivalent vaccinators when our vaccination rollout peaks later this year.“Not all of the people trained so far will be available to work full-time, so additional initiatives are also underway to further boost our pool of vaccinators.“Last week for instance, the Ministry of Health kicked off consultation with the health and disability sector about change to the Medicines Regulations to allow a range of people across the country to work as supplementary COVID-19 vaccinators.“As part of this change, we would target people with health and disability sector experience, such as kaiāwhina, internationally-trained healthcare professionals who are not currently registered in New Zealand and New Zealand-trained healthcare professionals with lapsed annual practising certificates. This new workforce would undergo specialist training first and their work would be fully supervised.“This change would also enable us to increase the numbers of Māori and Pacific in our vaccinator workforce, who are currently under-represented.“We’re also improving the Ministry of Health COVID-19 Surge Workforce database to better support the next phase of the scale-up. Since the database was launched in early last year, there have been many thousands of people register their interest in supporting the programme across various roles, including as vaccinators.“This is New Zealand’s largest-ever vaccination rollout and today’s milestone is great news as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver vaccines to New Zealanders. I look forward to seeing our trained workforce continue to expand,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 18 May 2021

Extra support for Pacific health providers to vaccinate,"The Government is providing a funding boost to Pacific health providers to assist them with the delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Pacific communities.“Our Pacific providers know and can reach our communities best. They will have access to vaccines on a rolling basis. This will enable them to vaccinate as many people as they can reach ,” Associate Minister of Health Aupito William Sio says.“These providers are trusted. Theyhave the language skills and cultural intelligence to engage with Pacific communities effectively.They will mobilise vaccination services to make it easy for people to access services, such as holding temporary clinics in our churches, workplaces and where our communities gather.“The second tranche of vaccinations will focus on non-border frontline workers and those living in high-risk settings. This includes those in the Counties Manukau DHB district over the age of 65 years or who live with relevant underlying health conditions.“This will also include older members of our Pacific communities who don’t live in residential care facilities. This is important as we know many of our older Pacific peoples live at home supported by their aiga,” Aupito William Sio said.Pacific health providers have the discretion to immunise family members living with older people, disabled people and people with relevant underlying health conditions when they accompany them to the appointment. This will be, however, with consideration to enough vaccine doses being available on site to meet expected demand until new deliveries arrive.There are a range of measures that the Government will implement to ensure equity and support for Pacific Peoples throughout the COVID-19 vaccine programme, including:Investing $10.5 million to support Pacific service delivery options.Investing $4 million to support Pacific providers to deliver COVID-19 vaccines.Investing $750,000 to support additional workforce training and development for Pacific Health providers and vaccinators.Training and support to ensure the cultural competency of the vaccinator workforce.Enabling community-based delivery so that Pacific people can easily access vaccination.Developing accessible information in our nine Pacific languages.Deliver a dedicated social marketing campaign to raise awareness for Pacific communities.“The COVID-19 Immunisation roll-out has a specific focus on encouraging our Pacific communities to get vaccinated.“Throughout the COVID-19 response, the Government has proactively recognised the need to ensure Pacific communities are vaccinated.“The Ministry of Health is working in partnership with the Ministry for Pacific Peoples to deliver a targeted Pacific engagement campaign. This includes communications in our nine Pacific languages and across channels like radio, print media, zoom and face-to-face fono,” says Aupito William Sio.","Publication Date: 19 March 2021

PM Ardern shares warm meeting with Samoa PM,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had a warm and productive meeting with Samoa Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata’afa in Wellington, today.The Prime Ministers reflected on the close and enduring relationship the two countries have shared in the 60 years since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, and since Samoa gained independence.“Aotearoa New Zealand is committed to enhancing and continuing to strengthen our relationship with Samoa as lifelong friends — or uō mamae — and I am proud to announce a special Prime Minister’s Fellowship in Prime Minister Mata’afa’s name to celebrate the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations,” Jacinda Ardern said.The Prime Ministers issued a Joint Statement acknowledging the strong cooperation on COVID-19 and vaccines, a commitment to work together to navigate post-pandemic economic challenges, the importance of regional unity, and the pre-eminent role of existing regional architecture, such as the Pacific Island Forum.They also agreed to strengthen cooperation on climate change, including Aotearoa New Zealand’s commitment to provide funding support to Samoa’s climate change priorities and the implementation of its climate change adaptation plans.The Prime Ministers reaffirmed their support for the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now.“Climate change has been identified as the top priority for the region. This is reflected in New Zealand’s fourfold increase in climate aid to $1.3 billion, with at least fifty percent going to the Pacific,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Some of this funding will go to supporting Samoa to deliver on its climate change priorities by providing climate finance towards Samoa’s Nationally Determined Contribution, National Adaptation Plan of Action, and other government efforts to address climate change, including adaptation and mitigation efforts.“We are committed to working closely together on the complex challenges facing our countries and communities, our Blue Pacific Continent, and indeed, the rest of the world, in a manner that demonstrates the manaakitanga and respect we have for each other,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 14 June 2022

This particularly includes women and indigenous peoples who are most negatively impacted by the global pandemic,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“It is also important that APEC continues to emphasise its strong support for global climate commitments and a low-emission, climate-resilient future for the region.“I was pleased that we could agree to a plan to halt the increase of harmful fossil fuel subsidies – which drive environmental degradation and contribute to climate change,” Nanaia Mahuta said.Minister Damien O’Connor also said that real progress had been made under New Zealand’s leadership of APEC“Since trade Ministers discussed vaccine supply chains in June, most APEC economies have made access to vaccines easier by lowering tariffs, rejecting export restrictions, and getting vaccines through ports faster.“Ministers agreed it is essential APEC supports the WTO in achieving an ambitious set of outcomes as we re-stabilise it in December. This approach will benefit all. Free, fair and open trade will get us all through the pandemic,” Damien O’Connor said.In hosting APEC, New Zealand’s priorities have been:Agreement on economic and trade policies to strengthen the COVID-19 recovery;Increasing inclusion and sustainability for a more resilient recovery, andPursuing innovation and a digitally enabled recovery.The APEC Ministerial Meeting is one of the major events in the series of events held during 8-13 November hosted by New Zealand.","Publication Date: 10 November 2021

1 million more Pfizer doses to arrive in July,"Pfizer has scheduled delivery of an estimated 1 million doses of vaccine to New Zealand during July, COVID1-9 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“These consignments will double the total number of Pfizer doses we have received this year to more than 1,900,000 – enough to fully vaccinate almost 1 million Kiwis,” Chris Hipkins said.“This is great news and reassuring to see our vaccine supply ramping up. It shows our plan for what is the biggest and most complex logistical undertaking ever by the health system is on track.“The doses will arrive in weekly drops, ramping up in quantity from mid July as we start to move to the wider population roll out.“The drops will enable us to continue vaccinating Groups 1,2, and 3, while giving us the certainty needed to start the general population rollout as planned.“The supplies means DHBs can keep delivering to their plans and start accelerating their way through Group 3 from mid July – which is everyone over the age of 65 and people with disabilities and some underlying health conditions. It’s a group of more than 1 million people and will take time to work through. As we start Group 4, we will significantly ramp up our vaccination efforts.”Chris Hipkins said around 20,000 doses a day were currently being administered and the Pfizer deliveries throughout July will enable this to increase significantly. At the peak of the programme in August and September we expect to be administering 50,000 doses per day.“This will add to the significant momentum already being generated by New Zealand’s vaccine programme.”Plan on track“To date, we’ve fully vaccinated over a quarter of a million people. That is a pleasing milestone. Our strategy has meant we’ve largely avoided having to stretch the time between first and second doses as many countries have,” Chris Hipkins said.“Work is well advanced to set up more vaccination sites, deliver mass vaccination events, and bring more GPs and pharmacies on-board to help with the rollout.“While we know the ongoing pandemic can impact vaccine delivery schedules, Pfizer has given us further assurances that the remaining deliveries for 2021 are also on track, just as their deliveries to date have been.“We have vaccinated more people than we had planned for at this point in time and more than 6,800 vaccinators have completed the necessary training to administer the Pfizer vaccine.“We have at our disposal one of the best vaccines in the world and starting later next month we will start making it available, for free, to everyone in New Zealand over the age of 16.”","Publication Date: 8 June 2021

Isolation period reduced from 10 to 7 days_ third vaccine becomes available,"COVID-19 cases and household contacts to isolate for a weekTwo negative rapid antigen tests required for household contacts250,000 Novavax vaccines here, people can book from tomorrowThe isolation period for COVID-19 cases and their household contacts will be reduced from 10 to seven days, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins announced today.“We remain committed to reducing the spread of Omicron to protect our health system and each other. However high case numbers and household contacts, and the current 10 day isolation requirement, is having a wider impact on many parts of our lives,” Chris Hipkins said.“There needs to be a balance between effectively controlling the outbreak and the flow-on effect for business and essential goods and services such as transport and food supply.“The most up to date public health advice is that there is a decline in infectiousness of Omicron over time, and that in most cases transmission occurs within seven days.“Our primary objective is to stop the chain of transmission as much as possible to manage the spread of Omicron. Seven days isolation will break the vast majority of potential transmissions, while ensuring people can get back to work quicker and therefore reducing the impact on business operations.”The change will come into effect from 11:59pm Friday 11 March.Household contacts will need to have a rapid antigen test at day 3 and day 7 of their isolation period. If they become symptomatic they should also get a test, and if the result is positive, they are required to isolate for seven days from that point.If a person is isolating and still has symptoms after seven days, they are advised to stay home until 24 hours after symptoms resolve.“I urge everyone to make sure they report their rapid antigen test result on My Covid Record, even if it is negative, so we can understand transmission within households and how the outbreak is spreading through communities,” Chris Hipkins said.“The reduction in the isolation period follows similar changes overseas and increasing evidence that people are most likely to transmit the virus earlier in their infectious period. This evidence also shows that the risk of reinfection within the first three months after someone has Omicron is very low.“For this reason, recovered cases will no longer need to self-isolate if they become a household contact within 90 days after having the virus. This is an increase from the current 28 days.“Under the Red setting of the COVID-19 Protection Framework there are additional public health measures in place that reduce the risk of onwards infection. These include limits on the sizes of gatherings, wearing face masks and physically distancing. I urge people to follow these guidelines to continue to protect our vulnerable friends and whānau,” Chris Hipkins said.Novavax available to book from tomorrow“New Zealanders awaiting the arrival of Novavax to get vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to make an appointment online or by phone from tomorrow,” Chris Hipkins said.“A shipment of more than 250,000 Novavax COVID-19 vaccines (Nuvaxovid) has arrived in New Zealand and preparations are well advanced for some vaccination centres to be able to offer it next week.“Novavax will be available for people aged over 18. It requires two doses, with a three week gap. It has not been approved as a booster dose.“While the Pfizer vaccine remains the preferred COVID-19 vaccine in New Zealand, Novavax is now available for those people who would prefer, or require, an alternative,” Chris Hipkins said.People are able to book a Novavax vaccine throughBookMyVaccine.nz or by calling Healthlinefrom Thursday 10 March, with the first vaccine appointments available at a limited number of sites from Monday 14 March.

Expanded vaccination order for health and disability_ education and prison workers,"A newly-signed Order means most people working in three key sectors will very soon need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for the sake of themselves, their workmates and their communities, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins has confirmed.The extended COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2021 comes into effect at 11.59pm on 25 October, requiring workers who face a high risk of exposure to COVID-19 and who work in the health and disability and education sectors or in prisons to be fully vaccinated.“This is a significant development as our vaccination programme continues to roll out,” says Chris Hipkins.“It’s a comprehensive Order, and will require all health and disability workers and education workers to have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by 15 November 2021.“General practitioners, pharmacists, community health nurses, midwives, paramedics, and healthcare and disability workers in facilities where vulnerable patients are treated (including ICU), are amongst those included.“It also covers many workers doing non-regulated healthcare work, for example providers in aged residential care and workers who enter homes to provide community support services.“In finalising the Order, it’s been decided that it will now apply to healthcare and disability workers from 15 November, as the date when they’ll be required to have had their first dose.“This aligns with the education sector and is a change from the 30 October date initially indicated, following feedback from the health and disability sector.“We recognise the sector as being supportive of the mandate but we’ve listened to their views on the proposed timeline, including the potential impact on staff rosters and a desire to support all staff to meet the timeframe.“The end result will be that both the health and disability workers and the education sector workers must be fully vaccinated by 1 January 2022.”For those working in the education sector, the amendment applies to early childhood services as well as registered schools, including State schools, State integrated school and all private schools.“Work is continuing on whether mandatory vaccinations will be required in the tertiary education sector.“Prison facilities are also included and the first deadline for those workers is 6 November. In that context, the order applies to prison staff, health care staff working in prisons, psychologists (working in prisons), and many of the people contracted to provide services to prisons.“We recognise that the health and disability, education and prison workforces have responded to the pandemic with dedication and an incredible amount of hard work and we thank them for that.“Because of the nature of their work, these groups are all at particular risk of being infected with COVID-19, and of passing it on to the vulnerable groups they work with, as well as whānau, and members of the wider community.“While most people in these sectors have already taken the necessary steps to protect themselves and those around them, having complete protection is critical to the country’s successful management of the pandemic.”Notes to editors:Workers who only sometimes work in school, prison or health and disability environments may also be subject to the Order, and should consult the Ministry of Health’s website.Workers who have proof of having been vaccinated overseas with one of Medsafe’s four approved vaccines will qualify as having met the terms of the Order.Border workers have been required by the Order to be vaccinated since 30 September.Dates by which workers in the different sectors will be required to be vaccinated by:Health and Education:First dose – 23.59 hrs 15 November 2021Second dose - 23.59 hrs 1 January 2022.Prisons:First dose – 23.59 hrs 6 November 2021Second dose – 23.59 hrs 8 December 2021","Publication Date: 23 October 2021

Government takes action to give Arts and Culture sector certainty,"The Government is extending the Arts and Culture Event Support Scheme to cover new and recurring events from 15 June 2022 to 31 January 2023.“The Government recognises the importance of giving the cultural events sector confidence and certainty, which is why we’re taking action to support the sector to begin planning events for the latter half of 2022,” Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Carmel Sepuloni said.Previously, the Scheme only covered events in this period if they were already planned before New Zealand moved to Red in January 2022.“This change aims to further support our artists, musicians, performers and Kiwis who make a living out of arts and culture. It also recognises that a critical part of securing our recovery will be the return of arts and cultural events for all New Zealanders to enjoy.“The Government remains absolutely committed to ensuring the arts and culture sector survives, adapts and thrives. That’s why the Government’s $374 million COVID-19 Arts and Culture Recovery Programme announced in May 2020 was boosted by an additional $121 million package in February 2022,”The move to extend coverage of the Arts and Culture Event Support Scheme to new events from 15 June comes alongside other changes for the Scheme designed to relieve pressure on the events sector as the country moves past this Omicron peak.Those changes include support for outdoor events that can now go ahead at Red under the COVID-19 Protection Framework but that may incur financial losses due to reduced audiences and support for financial losses for events that take place during the first six weeks of a change to Orange. The requirement for use of My Vaccine Pass at events has also been removed, to match the updated Covid Protection Framework settings.“The additional changes to the Arts and Culture Events Scheme extend support to event organisers as we transition to the new provisions of the COVID-19 Protection Framework, and provide Kiwis with opportunities to go out as their confidence increases. We’re working hard to deliver more certainty in an uncertain world.“The changes to the Framework represent a milestone for Aotearoa New Zealand’s response to the pandemic. As our country lifts its sights toward recovery, our communities can begin to enjoy events and express our diverse cultures,” said Carmel Sepuloni.Full details of the Arts and Culture Event Support Scheme are available atmch.govt.nz/arts-and-culture-event-support-scheme","Publication Date: 8 April 2022

Government opens new research and innovation hub,"The Government has invested $7.7 million in a research innovation hub which was officially opened today by Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Dr Ayesha Verrall.The new facility named Te Pā Harakeke Flexible Labs comprises 560 square metres of new laboratory space for research staff and is based at Callaghan Innovation’s Gracefield Innovation Quarter site in Lower Hutt.“Today’s opening of newly built cutting-edge lab facilities provides space to undertake more impactful research using new technologies. And could be used for things such as developing new vaccines for fighting COVID-19,” Research, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said.“Constructing new research facilities is part of a broader plan to improve the opportunities for researchers and industry alike to freely collaborate and make the most of skills and technologies we have available across Aotearoa New Zealand.“Innovation hubs are important catalysts of innovation where research groups are co-located to promote collaboration.“We want to see a more connected, resilient and adaptable research, science and innovation sector and this is a key aim of our system-wide review of the sector through the Te Ara Paerangi – Future Pathways programme.“These new state-of-the-art facilities are a prime example of the positive changes are already underway in the sector. This modular, flexible “turn-key” type of lab can enable scientists, researchers, innovators to carry out their work without having to build their own capital-intensive facilities.“Te Pā Harakeke will be occupied by Callaghan Innovation’s partner the Ferrier Research Institute. The Institute is a team of carbohydrate, analytical and bio-chemistry experts and will work on site with lipid nanoparticles to build research and manufacturing capability for mRNA vaccines and related technologies.“This will help strengthen our vaccine research capability, including resilience against infectious diseases. Earlier this year, the Government announced a $40.7 million investment to create a platform to grow our domestic RNA research base and connect this with industry to facilitate the production of new vaccines, treatments and diagnostics that can support wellbeing and better health outcomes for New Zealanders. As well as responding to COVID-19 this has the exciting potential to begin to address the treatment of cancers as well as neuro-degenerative diseases.“The Government is also boosting our pandemic resilience and preparedness for future pandemics in other areas such as through our $36 million investment in an Infectious Diseases Research Platform. The Ferrier Research Institute is contributing to this work”“It was also great to see the development of the new facility supporting the local economy. Callaghan Innovation worked closely with Lower Hutt-based firm Niche Modular to build the innovative and unique laboratories in a nearby factory, before they were relocated to their current site,” Dr Verrall said.","Publication Date: 3 August 2022

Further pandemic support to the Pacific,"The Government has announced further pandemic support for Pacific Island countries with vaccine boosters, COVID-19 anti-viral treatments, and by strengthening the capacity of the health workforce to respond to further pandemics.“The impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world, including the Pacific. As we continue our re-connections this year we have a clear focus on supporting the social and economic resilience of our Pacific partners and their health priorities,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“Aotearoa New Zealand stands alongside the Pacific to further support preparedness and response efforts. It reflects the importance we place on being there for our Pacific fanauthroughout this pandemic,” Aupito William Sio said.Nanaia Mahuta made the announcement in the Cook Islands, during a visit to Rarotonga Hospital where she met frontline health workers involved in the COVID-19 response.The package of support includes:Additional funding of $3.8 million for thePolynesian Health Corridors programmefor pandemic preparedness and response over the next year, to continue COVID-19 immunisation support, provide public health advice and help strengthen the health workforce.A $1.1 million contribution to the World Health Organisation to increase access to COVID-19 therapeutics in the wider Pacific, with accompanying technical support;Access to COVID-19 oral antivirals from Aotearoa New Zealand’s domestic supply for the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. There will be accompanying guidance and support, facilitated by the Polynesian Health Corridors team, through clinical specialists and organisations in Aotearoa New Zealand;Provision of second COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine boosters to the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau as requested.“The Polynesian Health Corridors programme sees workers from Aotearoa New Zealand step up with public health advice, vaccine rollout support, and health workforce capability building in the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu,” Aupito William Sio said.“The PHC programme facilitated New Zealand’s donation of almost 44,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Cook Islands. There was also support from clinicians who travelled to the islands to backfill the roles of local health workers during the vaccination rollout.“Our support will ensure Pacific countries have more tools to respond to COVID-19 to keep their populations safe.“Oral antiviral treatments and second boosters are an important addition to pandemic response efforts globally. They reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation following COVID-19 infection, especially for people with pre-existing health conditions,” Aupito William Siosaid.“Providing treatments and vaccines through our domestic supply, and increasing access to antiviral treatments in collaboration with the World Health Organization, will enhance countries’ ability to respond to the pandemic and save lives,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“Health systems across the world have felt the burden of COVID-19. It is our responsibility as a Pacific nation to work together with our Pacific partners to strengthen our collective capabilities to prepare for and respond to pandemics. In the long run, this helps us all in our efforts to achieve a safer, prosperous and resilient Pacific,” Nanaia Mahuta said.","Publication Date: 14 October 2022

Minister Sio to attend Niue_s Constitution Day,"The Minister for Pacific Peoples and Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Aupito William Sio will represent the Government of Aotearoa New Zealand at Niue’s Constitution Day commemorations this week.“Constitution Day on 19 October is the most important event in Niue’s calendar, and I am looking forward to sharing this day with the Government and the people of Niue”, Minister Sio said.“After the disruption caused by COVID-19 border closures, this is another opportunity to reconnect with our closest Pacific partners and re-affirm our enduring links with Niue and our friends from the region.“Aotearoa New Zealand’s relationship with Niue stretches back more than a century and was cosolidated in 1974 when Niue elected self-government in free association with New Zealand. Constitution Day is an opportunity to reflect not only on our common history, but our shared partnership and deep whakapapa connections. Our family ties are real”.In Niue, Minister Sio will meet with Premier Dalton Tagelagi and Niue’s Minister of Social Services Sauni Tongatule, and the wider Cabinet. He will also meet with officials at the forefront of Niue’s COVID-19 response, and progress cooperation in revitalising the Vagahau Niue language.“Niue’s management of the pandemic over more than two years and since borders opened has been extraordinary. Aotearoa has supported Niue closely during the pandemic, and my visit will enable me to pass on our Government’s appreciation to all those who have worked tirelessly to keep Niue safe.Niue has high vaccination rates, aided by the provision of vaccines through the Polynesian Health Corridors programme, and this has assisted the health team and community. That Niue has only ever recorded around 80 cases of the virus, and has just two cases currently is a credit to its border and health management, village community leaders and health sector workers.In line with the Niue-New Zealand Statement of Partnership Minister Sio will also meet with language and cultural leaders to discuss the preservation and revitalisation of Taoga Niue and Vagahau Niue.“Investing in the preservation and resilience of Taoga Niue and Vagahau Niue is a priority for the New Zealand Government and the Niuean community who have long advocated for, and supported the recently launched Pacific Languages Strategy. Our commitment reflects our support for intergenerational and cultural resilience in the Pacific and the importance of language to all our well-being.“My discussions in Niue will enable us to better reflect on how we can better support generations of Niueans, both in Niue and Aotearoa New Zealand to strengthen pathways and resources for learning Vagahau Niue,” said Aupito William Sio.","Publication Date: 18 October 2022

Funding for vaccine development to help prevent rheumatic fever,"Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall has announced today the Government is supporting the development of a vaccine to help prevent rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.“Rheumatic fever can have a devastating impact, especially for Māori and Pacific children and young people,” Ayesha Verrall said.“As an infectious diseases doctor, I cared for rangatahi who experienced some of the worst outcomes from this illness. Several had heart valve replacements that became infected, and some suffered strokes. I remember one young woman who needed a heart transplant, and later tragically died.”The University of Auckland will lead research next year into the vaccine development, which will complement existing work underway in Australia.“Because New Zealand and Australia are among the few developed countries to still have rheumatic fever, it makes sense for us to collaborate to develop a vaccine. This $10 million investment will help ensure the vaccine is appropriate for the strains of Strep A circulating in Aotearoa New Zealand,” Ayesha Verrall said.Funding will also support activities such as enhanced surveillance of Group A streptococcus, more infrastructure for laboratory testing, and preparations to ensure Aotearoa New Zealand is ready to conduct clinical trials.In 2020/21, 107 people were hospitalised for the first time with rheumatic fever in New Zealand.Other Government action to reduce rheumatic fever includes the expansion of the Healthy Homes Initiative to prevent childhood hospitalisations - by increasing the number of children living in warm, dry homes.Rheumatic fever starts from a strep throat infection, andcauses the heart, joints, brain and skin to become inflamed and swollen.People who’ve caught rheumatic fever need to have monthly antibiotic injections for at least 10 years, to prevent it returning - and developing into rheumatic heart disease.Māori and Pacific tamariki and rangatahi between the ages of four and 19 years old have the highest rates of rheumatic fever. Among Pacific peoples, rheumatic fever occurs mainly in Samoan and Tongan children and young people.The Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor has published a report today on rheumatic fever. This Evidence Summary found preventing strep throat infection through vaccination could make a significant difference to the rates of infection and subsequent complications of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.You can read it here:https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/topics/antimicrobial-resistance-and-infectious-disease/rheumatic-fever","Publication Date: 19 November 2021

Govt books resilient amid challenging global times,"The resilient economy and the Government’s responsible financial management means New Zealand is well positioned to respond to a difficult and challenging global environment.For the three months to the end of September, the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) recorded a deficit of $2.6 billion, a little higher than forecast at Budget 2022 in May. Tax revenue was slightly below expectations, while expenses were slightly above forecast.“The latest figures are broadly in line with forecasts. They show the resilience of the economy despite the global challenges New Zealand finds itself facing. More people are in paid work which helps to ease cost of living pressures, while the Government is there with them and supporting them with the recently announced childcare package along with the extended fuel tax cuts and half price public transport fares,” Grant Robertson said.“We are however not immune to what happens overseas which will put pressure on the Government’s books. We will continue to responsibly manage our finances and that means tough choices will be required as we tread a pathway back to surplus.Core Crown tax revenue was $133 million below forecast at $26.7 billion, due to lower-than-expected GST returns and lower Fuel Excise Duties and Road Users Charges, which were cut to support New Zealanders with cost of living pressures. That has more than offset the increase in people being in work.Core Crown expenses were $243 million above forecast at $31.2 billion, due to higher interest costs and health expenses, including for charges for vaccines that occurred during this period.Net debt stood at 19.8 percent of GDP, which was above forecast due to the impact of market conditions affecting the financial portfolio held by the New Zealand Super Fund and ACC derivatives. Using the old measure, Net core Crown debt is below forecast at 38.4 percent of GDP compared with projections of 39.8 percent of GDP.“Our debt levels are among the lowest in the OECD and well below the Government’s debt ceiling of 30 percent, ensuring we are well positioned to weather further economic shocks,” Grant Robertson said“Our successful economic plan and responsible fiscal management means New Zealand is in a strong starting position that allows us to focus on what matters to Kiwis – growing wages and cost of living pressures, investing in hospitals, schools, and housing and addressing climate change.“Our economy is open and larger than before Covid, we produce what the world wants and our immigration reset is making a difference in attracting overseas workers to address workforce pressures. The summer is full of promise with the return of increasing numbers of tourists. However, the global environment is challenging and we will have to be careful and balanced in our response.“We continue to prioritise our spending and target support to where it is needed most while keeping debt in check and making important investments in New Zealanders security and wellbeing. This is the right and responsible approach in these uncertain times,” Grant Robertson said.","Publication Date: 8 November 2022

Agreement advanced to purchase up to 5 million COVID_19 vaccines,"The Government has confirmed an in-principle agreement to purchase up to 5 million COVID-19 vaccines – enough for 5 million people – from Janssen Pharmaceutica, subject to the vaccine successfully completing clinical trials and passing regulatory approvals in New Zealand, says Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods.“Thisagreement forms part of our portfolio approach to ensure that we have the ability to access a range of vaccine options, if and when a suitable vaccine is developed and approved,” says Megan Woods.“It is an initial agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica, and we expect a formal advance purchase agreement to be finalised in coming weeks.“The agreement with Janssen would see the first doses – up to 2 million – delivered from the third quarter of 2021. We have the option to purchase up to 3 million additional doses, which would be delivered throughout 2022.“A key point of difference for the Janssen vaccine is that it’s likely to be a single-dose vaccine and is compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels, so it may potentially be more efficient to administer.”Megan Woods said Janssen, along with its parent company Johnson & Johnson, have a very strong track record producing safe and effective pharmaceutical products for use globally and in New Zealand.“This gives us confidence in their ability to develop, manufacture and deliver a safe and effective vaccine,” Megan Woods saidThis announcement follows the Government’s recent agreement to purchase 1.5 million doses of vaccine – enough for 750,000 people – from Pfizer and BioNTech, and works alongside other aspects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy, including membership of the global COVAX Facility.Megan Woods said negotiations with other pharmaceutical companies are progressing well.“The COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Taskforce are working to ensure that additional agreements are in place to complete the vaccine portfolio. Our main priority is to make sure New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours have access to safe and effective vaccines.The Ministry of Health is preparing for a range of vaccine scenarios and how best to sequence the delivery of vaccines once supply becomes available. Three broad considerations are being explored:Those at risk of contracting COVID-19Those at risk of spreading COVID-19Those at risk of increased morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.Ensuring equity of outcomes, including protection for Māori, Pacific peoples and our most vulnerable population groups, such as older people, disabled people, health workers, essential workers and border staff are some of our primary considerations in the availability of vaccines.","Publication Date: 19 November 2020

New Zealand leadership contributes to significant progress at the WTO,"New Zealand’s leadership has contributed to a number of significant outcomes and progress at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which concluded in the early hours of Friday morning after a week of intense negotiations between its 164 members.A major outcome is a new Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies following negotiations this week facilitated by Minister for Trade and Export Growth Damien O’Connor.“New Zealand has been at the forefront of calling for an agreement on fisheries subsidies for over twenty years, so this is a significant milestone,” Damien O’Connor said.“I was very proud to assist the WTO Director-General as Facilitator for the fisheries negotiation. What we agreed this week will have a meaningful impact on the sustainability of our fisheries resources and the livelihoods of the world’s fishers.”The agreement includes important prohibitions on subsidies related to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; subsidies regarding over-fished stocks; and subsidies provided to fishing taking place on the unregulated high seas.“While negotiators were unable to find agreement on all disciplines, WTO Members have agreed to continue negotiations on these outstanding and very important issues ahead of the WTO’s 13th Ministerial Conference, which is expected to be held in 2023,” Damien O’Connor said.“This has been a hugely significant meeting, and has happened at a very difficult time.  Just as the world is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, we face growing geo-political tensions including Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine.“At times like these, multilateral organisations like the WTO are more important than ever for small, globally connected countries like New Zealand.""Another significant outcome from MC12 is that the Members have agreed a package of responses to future emergencies including pandemics, to build on the lessons from our respective experiences in responding to COVID-19.  This includes the “TRIPS waiver” on COVID-19 vaccines, which is designed to facilitate the production and distribution of vaccines in developing countries.“New Zealand was an early supporter of the TRIPS waiver, as we strongly support developing countries being able to better access vaccine IP and increase the supply of vaccines” Damien O’Connor said.Ministers also agreed a Declaration on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics, covering issues like transparency and the value of timely and accurate information.“I am also pleased to say that WTO Members have renewed the E-commerce Moratorium until the next Ministerial Conference. This continues the long standing practice of not applying tariffs or duties to electronic transmissions. We know that this is a key enabler for predictable global digital trade for businesses,” Damien O’Connor said.“It’s been a gruelling week, and we didn’t get everything we wanted. There is still an urgent need for further substantial, meaningful progress on agricultural trade reform, including on domestic subsidies, to help feed the world’s population at a time of increased food insecurity.“There is also still considerable work to do to improve the functioning of the WTO to be able to respond more rapidly to the kinds of crises we have seen in the past two years. These are things that we will continue to work on ahead of the 13th Ministerial Conference,” Damien O’Connor said.Ministerial conferences are the highest decision making body of the WTO. They are traditionally scheduled to occur every two years, but due to COVID-19, the MC12 was the first one to occur in five years.Damien O’Connor returns to New Zealand today from Europe.","Publication Date: 18 June 2022

Access to COVID_19 boosters for those most at risk,"Second COVID-19 Pfizer booster dose recommended for the most vulnerable six months after first boosterApproximately 850,000 New Zealanders expected to be eligibleChanges ensure more equitable access to second boosterThe Government is introducing a Bill to amend the Medicines Act, enabling voluntary booster doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to be administered to the most vulnerable by all vaccinators without a prescription.“The amendments make it easier to get a second booster dose for those without ready access to a GP and apply to around 850,000 people who are at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.“Amending the Act is a better and more enduring way to manage boosters from this point in the pandemic, rather than using the temporary Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19 – Medicines Act 1981) Immediate Modification Order that is currently in place.“Under a truncated timetable agreed to by Parliament, the Bill will go to the Health select committee and be reported back on June 20. The Bill will be considered by the House again in that week.“The guidance on a second booster follows advice from the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group (CV TAG) on waning of immunity after a COVID-19 booster dose, and the groups in which this may occur more rapidly.“The majority of people in these groups will become eligible from July, following advice that six months is an appropriate gap between doses.“When the Bill passes, the Director General of Health will be able to formally confirm eligibility criteria and details of the rollout of the second booster.”Associate COVID-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall said a booster is particularly important for those most at risk as we move into winter.“These changes enable second booster doses to be widely available at vaccination sites and able to be administered by all vaccinators. There is sufficient Pfizer vaccine in stock with current supply sitting at around two million doses.“The proposed eligible groups are: people aged 65 years and over, Māori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and over, residents of aged care and disability care facilities and severely immunocompromised people who have received a three-dose primary course and a first booster.“The proposal to reduce the age of eligibility for older Māori and Pacific peoples recognises that they have been disproportionately affected in the current Omicron outbreak and are at greater risk of hospitalisation and severe disease from COVID-19.”Dr Verrall strongly encouraged first and second booster uptake as an important step to protect people‘s health and reduce the pressure on the health system as winter and winter illnesses set in.“Getting a booster reduces the likelihood of a more serious infection and helps keep people out of hospital.“A two-dose primary course and a booster dose provides very good and lasting protection for most people, which means we can be more targeted in the rollout of the second booster. So, for those who haven’t had a first booster, please act now.”","Publication Date: 7 June 2022

New vaccination requirement for non_citizen travellers to New Zealand,"Full vaccination will become a requirement for non-New Zealand citizens arriving into the country from 1 November, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“Getting vaccinated is the most effective measure against the transmission of COVID-19, and the risk of serious illness or death,” Chris Hipkins said.“To further reduce the possibility of the virus getting through our border, we are introducing the requirement for air travellers aged 17 and over, who are not New Zealand citizens, to be fully vaccinated to enter New Zealand.“This is an important step in our Reconnecting New Zealand strategy.”Travellers will be required to declare their vaccination status when registering with the Managed Isolation Allocation System, as well as presenting proof of vaccination or a relevant exemption to their airline and to Customs officers once they land.The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group has recommended that a full course of any of the 22 COVID-19 vaccines approved by a government or approval authority, with the last dose being at least 14 days before arrival, will be acceptable at this stage. Guidance will be prepared on what will qualify as evidence of a vaccination or an exemption.“Most people coming to New Zealand tell us they are already vaccinated. This requirement makes it formal and will provide an extra layer of protection at the border. It will work well alongside the announcement today that everyone on board an Air New Zealand aircraft travelling internationally will need to be fully vaccinated from February 2022.”Everybody arriving will still be required to complete 14 days in Managed Isolation and Quarantine, and all travellers except those from exempt locations will still need to have evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result from an accredited laboratory within 72 hours of their first scheduled international flight.“Even a single case presents a risk. However, high and wide-spread vaccination rates will mean more freedoms, fewer restrictions, and the day-to-day confidence that protection from the virus brings.“This requirement will be an interim measure while development continues on the traveller health declaration system, which will introduce the ability to digitally verify the vaccination status of people arriving into New Zealand.The requirement will be brought in with an amendment to the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020 (Air Border Order).Those subject to the requirement who fail to present proof of vaccination may be subject to an infringement notice under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Act 2020, which under a Bill currently before the House would see infringements carrying a maximum fine of $4000.The requirement will not apply to New Zealand citizens, children under the age of 17, and those who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons.RSE workers coming to NZ as part of the one-way QFT arrangement with Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu will also be exempt due to existing vaccination requirements, as will refugees. There will also be a process to seek exemptions from the Director General of Health on humanitarian grounds, or where people travelling with New Zealand citizens have not had the opportunity to be vaccinated within the timeframes.","Publication Date: 3 October 2021

International collaboration delivers new tools to help tackle agricultural emissions,"TheGlobal Research on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (GRA),an alliance backed by New Zealand is delivering promising new technologies such as cow vaccines and probiotics to tackle agricultural emissions, Minister of Agriculture Damien O’Connor said.Eleven research projects, funded and delivered under the alliance of 64 countries, have been recently completed.Damien O’Connor said reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions is a global challenge and a key part of the Government’sFit for a Better World – Accelerating our Economic Potential Roadmap,released last year.“The completed projects have enabled important discoveries, significantly advanced scientists’ understanding, and led to the development of technologies to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions,” Damien O’Connor said.Project milestones include:new technologies for developing methane vaccines which have now been included in New Zealand’s domestic vaccine programme for cattlebetter understanding how ‘direct-fed’ microbial and silage inoculant products can be produced to enable cows to deliver beneficial microbes to pastures, which includes contributing to Fonterra’s new methane-reducing probiotic for cows calledKowbuchaTMpotential nitrification inhibitors to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from grazed pasturesidentifying new potential compounds and ways to inhibit the production of methane in the rumen of cattleboosting scientific understanding of how irrigation management can reduce nitrous oxide emissions from soils without affecting pasture dry matter productionNew Zealand contributed one third of the global investment of $28.7 million in the projects.Damien O’Connor said the GRA provides a multinational platform to identify global climate issues and work together to make breakthroughs and develop practical solutions.“The GRA enables us to identify, understand, and tackle issues more rapidly than if each country acted alone.  It also provides a network for sharing, so the research outcomes can have wider benefits across the globe.”“Fit for a Better Worldhas bold targets for New Zealand to move to a low emissions economy.  The important discoveries and technologies from this GRA-funded research add to the growing global toolkit of practical tools and techniques available to our farmers and growers.“New Zealand has been a leader in pastoral farm production, now we need to be leaders at reducing while producing,” Damien O’Connor said.","Publication Date: 17 May 2021

This will come into place from 2 July 2022.100 per cent of corrections staff in prisons, and as of 23 June 2022 97 per cent of active border workers were fully vaccinated.“As we have previously said we keep vaccine mandates under continuous review and remove them when safe to do so,” COVID-19 Response MinisterDr Ayesha Verrall said.“Vaccination has been one of our strongest and most effective defences to protect against COVID-19. It’s helped protect our border and corrections workers and their whānau. But we feel the requirement has served its purpose well.“The risk COVID-19 poses at the border is much lower than it was previously. Alongside high rates of vaccination amongst border workers the number of passengers arriving by air with COVID-19 is less than 3%.“Corrections staff will also no longer be included in the Vaccination Order. Currently all corrections staff in prisons are fully vaccinated and 72% of people in prison have been fully vaccinated.“How we manage COVID-19 in Aotearoa continues to change and as certain protections are no longer required we have shown we will remove them.“We have high levels of vaccination amongst the general population and we have increasing protection in the population from prior infection, so tools like vaccine mandates in most settings are no longer necessary.“Our corrections and border workers have played an extremely important role throughout the pandemic. I can’t thank them enough for their dedication and commitment to keeping us all safe,” Dr Ayesha Verrall said.The Vaccination Order remains in place for health and disability workers as they continue to have close interactions withpeople who are at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19. The settings for health and disability workers are reviewed regularly.","Publication Date: 28 June 2022

Regional economies hit _2 billion milestone,"Government investment in regional economic development projects has passed a $2 billion milestone as support for jobs, businesses and infrastructure steps up a gear.Economic and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash says funds administered by the Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit at MBIE (Kānoa-RDU) have now paid more than $2.1 billion to projects since 2018.“From the Provincial Growth Fund to the Infrastructure Reference Group’s shovel-ready projects, as well as other funds, we are backing communities all over the country and giving them confidence to keep investing,” Stuart Nash said.“It has been a priority to invest in regional infrastructure which had been previously run down. These investments are even more important as we respond to the economic shock caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.“Some modest investments have proved to be the most valuable. Organisations at the heart of communities, like marae and Pasifika churches, have become central in our COVID-19 vaccination and testing efforts.“As part of the PGF reset in 2020 we invested in smaller community initiatives to deal with the impact of COVID-19 on jobs and businesses.  This year many investments have come full circle. Dozens of newly-renovated marae and Pasifika churches have become COVID-19 vaccine and testing centres.“For example last year Wharekawa Marae in north Waikato received $252,000 for renovation work on its buildings and grounds. This September, it was the site of a pop-up testing facility that swabbed more than half its community after a local positive case.“Te Puna Ora o Mataatua’s Māori health academy in Whakatāne received a $2.95 million grant from Te Ara Mahi fund, so 300 young people could receive training and work placements. Graduates are now helping deliver vaccines and tests in the Bay of Plenty.“One of the earliest PGF grants, to FI Innovations in Southland, was $370,000 to help buy equipment for large-scale 3D printing. It can manufacture medical parts such as ventilator valves, should DHBs need them during the pandemic.“Other investments are significant for enabling development of infrastructure to secure regional jobs, businesses and economies in the face of global uncertainty.“In the north, the rail network between Swanson and Whangarei had been in managed decline. Kānoa-RDU investment of $219 million transformed the 180 kilometre line which now carries modern shipping containers, removing thousands of trucks from the roads.“In Southland and Otago, grants of $7 million for manufacturing businesses and a training academy aretackling local skills shortage andhelping school leavers play a part in the region’s growingengineering sector.“In Rotorua, a PGF grant of $875,000 is helping to build a state-of-the-art film studio and establish training schemes to nurture the screen sector and upskill the local workforce.In Opotiki a new $112 million harbour and marine development will lead to an expanded aquaculture industry and unlock the economic potential of the town and its people.“The country’s largest fishing port of Nelson is getting a fit for purpose slipway to handle larger vessels. Wairoa’s rural bridges are being strengthened to handle the ‘wall of wood’ from the region’s exotic forest plantations. A Tāupo company has government backing to develop new techniques to harvest valuable silica from geothermal steam and old mines.“This infrastructure investment is well overdue. The momentum of regional economic development is now picking up pace. We reached the $2 billion milestone just ten months after the $1 billion milestone in February 2021, which itself took three years to achieve.“While the $2 billion achievement is impressive, it is only half the story.  There is another $2 billion in investment in the pipeline, as Kānoa-RDU pays funds already allocated to projects, once they meet agreed milestones.“On top of that, the Regional Strategic Partnership Fund unveiled earlier this year is providing another $200 million as ‘seed funding’ for the regions.“I am excited to watch the investment of Kānoa funds continue to make a difference, as we build productive, sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies across New Zealand,” said Stuart Nash.Note for editorsKānoa-RDU was originally established in 2018 as the Provincial Development Unit within MBIE. It has created around 13,000 jobs during the lifetime of the contracts, and now administers more than 1,700 projects worth $4.2 billion across six investment funds:Provincial Growth FundCOVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (Infrastructure Reference Group)Regional Investment Opportunities (NZ Upgrade Programme)Strategic Tourism Assets Protection ProgrammeWorker Redeployment Package (COVID-19 Response)Regional Strategic Partnership FundN.B.

Monkeypox vaccination available to eligible people from next week,"A vaccine for people at risk of mpox (Monkeypox) will be available if prescribed by a medical practitioner to people who meet eligibility criteria from Monday 16 January, says Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall.5,000 vials of the vaccine have been obtained, enough for up to 20,000 people. A further supply of additional vaccines is anticipated to arrive in Aotearoa later this year.Those initially eligible for the vaccine include:Close physical contacts of people infected with mpox, such as sexual partners and people who live in the same household.Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) who have multiple sexual partners, and trans and cisgender women who are in intimate relationships with these eligible men.Those recommended to have the vaccine by medical specialists.From Tuesday 10 January, people can complete an initial assessment to check if they are at risk of mpox athttps://www.burnettfoundation.org.nzor by ringing the mpox Healthline on 0800 116 672 between 8am and 8pm.Eligible people may be offered a consultation with a medical practitioner at a dedicated clinic. As part of this consultation the option of receiving the vaccine as well as the potential risks and benefits will be discussed.The vaccine may be prescribed by a medical practitioner following the consultation and provided in line with section 29 of the Medicines Act.“We encourage eligible people to make an appointment for a free consultation with a doctor by calling Healthline. The consultation is needed as this vaccine has not yet been approved by Medsafe, the New Zealand medicines regulator. The company responsible for the vaccine is expected to apply to Medsafe shortly,” Ayesha Verrall said.In the initial phase, the mpox consultation service is prioritising first dose for the eligible population. Timing of the recommended second dose is a minimum 28 day interval and can be up to 2 years after the first dose.This vaccine can also be given to close physical contacts of people infected with mpox after they have been exposed to mpox. If this is within four days after first exposure to mpox it will provide the highest chance of avoiding the disease. If people think they have been exposed to mpox they should call Healthline.There have been 41 reported cases of mpox in New Zealand as of 9 January. Mpox did not get a foothold in New Zealand in 2022 like it did in other countries. This is down to the great collaboration of community organisations, public health teams, and people taking sensible steps to reduce their risk,” Ayesha Verrall said.Anyone with any concerns about mpox should seek advice from the place they normally receive health advice, which could be their GP, sexual health clinic or Healthline on 0800 116 672.Editor’s note:The vaccine can only be made available under section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981. This allows for ‘unapproved’ vaccines to be provided to individual medical practitioners for a particular patient after assessing the patient’s needs. The Act also prevents the brand name of the vaccine and volumes available being promoted due to its ‘unapproved’ status.Advertising the availability of unapproved medicines is prohibited by section 20 of the Medicines Act 1981. This means that the vaccine cannot be advertised nor its availability promoted. It can only be offered by a medical practitioner to a consumer as a proposed medical treatment and then administered after a full informed consent process.","Publication Date: 9 January 2023

APEC finance ministers focus on inclusive_ sustainable COVID recovery,"APEC finance ministers will continue to work together to respond to the effects of COVID-19 and ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery while capitalising on the opportunity to build a more resilient future.The New Zealand Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson chaired the virtual APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting from Wellington.“While economic activity in the region has rebounded and vaccination rates are rising, the recovery from COVID-19 has been uneven. Some sectors, such as tourism, small and medium-sized businesses, and some groups, such as women and indigenous peoples, continue to be disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,”Grant Robertson said.“Finance ministers have had constructive discussions on the actions and policies APEC economies have implemented to combat the pandemic and the need for a balanced approach to preserve long term fiscal sustainability while supporting wellbeing, targeting support to where it is needed most and tackling long-standing issues of climate change and biodiversity loss.Attendees included finance ministers from all 21 APEC economies, APEC Business Advisory Council Chair Rachel Taulelei, representatives from the OECD, IMF, WBG, and ADB, and incoming APEC Finance Ministers’ Process Chair Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith of Thailand.In a joint statement issued after the meeting, the APEC finance ministers agreed to use all available policy tools to address COVID and support a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive recovery; maintain macroeconomic and financial stability; refrain from competitive exchange rate devaluations; step-up efforts to expand vaccine manufacture and supply and support global vaccine sharing efforts; reiterate the importance of a free and fair trade and investment environment with the WTO at its centre; and accelerate the digital transformation.Ministers also agreed on the refreshed Cebu Action Plan strategy, which encourages economies to pay due regard toAPEC’s new guiding document, the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040, and APEC’s new structural reform agenda, the Enhanced APEC Agenda for Structural Reform.“It was a privilege to join with fellow APEC finance ministers to strengthen our bonds and to reflect on our collective progress to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.This meeting has reinforced that we have strategies and tools available to us that can continue to drive recovery while also tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of people across all APEC economies,"" Grant Robertson said.Note to editors:The Cebu Action Plan was agreed by Finance Ministers during the Philippines’ 2015 host year and sets out the 10-year high-level work programme of the Finance Ministers’ Process. 2021 marks the year of a mandated mid-point review. The review gives an opportunity for economies to consider the impact of COVID-19 and the recently agreed Putrajaya Vision 2040. As part of the strategy refresh New Zealand has recommended the adoption of a Champion Economies model which would allow individual economies to volunteer to run multi-year work programmes on specific policy issues.","Publication Date: 22 October 2021

Auckland boundary to change 15 December,"Auckland boundary settings to change from 15 December, ensuring travel out for all vaccinated people or those with a negative test resultCountry better prepared - 82 percent New Zealanders fully vaccinated, compared to 23 percent three months ago and projections of 90 percent fully vaccinated by mid-DecemberOn 15 December Aucklanders who have been vaccinated or tested will be able to reconnect with the rest of New Zealand in time for Christmas and summer, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.To minimise the risk of COVID-19 spreading from Auckland to other parts of the country travellers will have to be either fully vaccinated or have a negative test within 72 hours of departure. This requirement will be in place for the core summer period of December 15 2021 to January 17 2022.“Aucklanders have faced restrictions for an extended period of time to keep the rest of New Zealand safe. But with increased rates of vaccination it’s time to open up the ability to travel again,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Confirming December 15 as the date the boundary requirements change provides certainty. Aucklanders can now book summer travel and accommodation with confidence and businesses inside Auckland and around the rest of the country can plan for summer travellers.“The boundary is of course two ways, so the changes also mean Aucklanders and Auckland businesses can start receiving New Zealanders from all over the country, allowing families and friends to reconnect and business to receive a much needed boost before Christmas.“Police will have operational discretion on the enforcement of these rules. Police undertake random spot checks to enforce a range of laws on our roads, such as drink driving, and will take the same approach here.“On the northern boundary, and the gateway to Northland, Police will work with Iwi to ensure people can move, but also that the people of Northland have confidence in the checks that are in place.“We have given special consideration to the South Island. The combination of the vaccine or testing requirement for Air New Zealand combined with the ability for the inter-islander to operate the same regime will provide solid measures to slow any spread to the South.“Cabinet will confirm on November 29 its decision to move Auckland into the new traffic light system which we expect will occur soon after the 29th. Auckland will initially move into Red, the highest level in the traffic light.“We are also confirming today that the rest of the country will move into the framework at the same time as Auckland. Those parts of the country with lower vaccination rates will move into the new system at Red, which has greater protections than the current Alert Level 2, meaning there will be stronger measures to minimise the risk of spread.“This decision carefully balances the need to give Aucklanders the ability to move and comfort to the rest of New Zealand that we’re still taking steps to slow the spread of COVID.“We have deliberately set the date for the boundary restrictions to change in a month’s time in order to give the rest of New Zealand time to move into the safer traffic light system and the chance to increase vaccination rates even further.“82 percent of New Zealanders are now fully vaccinated compared to just 23 percent when Delta arrived three months ago, so we are in a much safer position to ease boundary restrictions.“We will be in an even safer position by mid-December when it’s expected New Zealand as a whole will be around 90 percent fully vaccinated.“The steps we have taken to date have undeniably saved lives and slowed the spread of the virus that otherwise could have moved through the country very quickly.“But elimination and the alert levels were never intended as a forever strategy. High vaccination rates now offer us the ability to change our approach and move into the next chapter of our COVID response,” Jacinda Ardern said.The Auckland boundary will formally lift at 11.59pm Tuesday 14 DecemberPeople travelling out of Auckland from 15 December will be covered by the vaccination or testing requirement up until 17 January.Police will have operational discretion on the enforcement for these rules and perform spot checks.On the northern boundary, Police will work with iwi to ensure people can move, but also that the people of Northland have confidence in the checks that are in place.It is intended that people breaking the rules will face an infringement fine of $1,000.Checks for travellers out of Auckland Airport will be done at check-in. Air New Zealand have made a vaccine certificate or test a requirement before New Zealanders can fly, and these requirements begin on the 15th of December also.We will be enabling inter-island ferries to require proof of vaccination or a negative pre-departure test in order to travel between Wellington and Picton","Publication Date: 17 November 2021

COVID_19 vaccine roll_out plan,"Targeted roll-out over next 3-4 months will start to reach 2 million Kiwis in most at risk groupsPlan prioritises people most at risk of harm if they get the virus and those who live and work in places where they are most likely to pick up COVID-19Those in South Auckland who’re over 65 or who have underlying health issues to start being vaccinated from the end of MarchMinimising risk of future outbreaks central to Government plan and prioritisationThe Government is targeting those most at risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 and those most at risk of getting seriously sick from it in the next phase of the vaccine roll-out, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.“A top priority this year is to make sure New Zealanders get free, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,” Chris Hipkins said.“We are setting out the plan today after securing enough Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for everyone in New Zealand to get the two doses they need to be fully vaccinated against the virus.“The Ministry of Health is working with Pfizer on a delivery schedule to ensure a smooth rollout and a scaling up of our vaccination programme.“Over 2 million New Zealanders are in line to start receiving the vaccine over the next four months with a focus on protecting those most at risk of getting the virus or being harmed by it, while also reducing the chance of ongoing spread and future outbreaks,” Chris Hipkins said.“Our plan is clear – first protect those most at risk of picking up the virus in their workplace, reducing the risk of future outbreaks and lockdowns and then protecting those most at risk of getting seriously ill if they get the virus,” Chris Hipkins said.“Our sequencing plan provides certainty to the over 2 million Kiwis who can expect to start being vaccinated during the initial stages of our roll-out over the next 3-4 months.“This is a balanced plan that prioritises reducing the chance of future outbreaks while protecting our elders, those with underlying health conditions and those who live in locations where we know outbreaks have occurred.“We are asking all New Zealanders to get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect your whānau, their lives and their livelihoods.“Every New Zealander will be able to get a vaccine and the vaccine will be free. The rest of the population will be able to be vaccinated from July onwards and our plan is to have as many people as possible vaccinated by the end of the year.“As with the rest of our COVID-19 response we will make continuous improvements and adjustments to the vaccination roll-out. Our goal is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible and that will require some flexibility within the sequencing.“Further planning is underway on our ongoing response to COVID-19 including our management of the border. However the biggest factor in lifting COVID-19 restrictions will be a timely and high uptake of the vaccine,” Chris Hipkins said.There are four main groups (timings will overlap, and dates might shift slightly as the Ministry continues to undertake modelling):Group 1Our 50,000 border and MIQ workers, their household contacts and the people they live with. This started last month and the vast bulk will be completed this month, with at least one dose administered.Group 2Approximately 480,000 frontline workers and people living in high-risk settings. Starting with the 57,000 healthcare workers on community frontlines, and then moving through to healthcare workers protecting our most vulnerable and some priority populations. This started in February and will continue through to May.Group 3Priority populations. Approximately 1.7 million people who are at higher risk if they catch COVID-19. This is planned to start in May.Group 4The remainder of the general population – approximately 2 million people. Starting from July.“Approximately 40,000 courses are being allocated to Māori and Pacific providers who are working directly with older people, and we are also recognising the special circumstances of South Auckland,” Chris Hipkins said.“Anyone who lives in the Counties Manukau DHB area who is 65 and older or who has an underlying health condition is also in Group 2. This recognises that there are many border operations and MIQ facilities and their workforces based in this area.Chris Hipkins said there will be a range of options to make it as easy as possible for people to access to the vaccine.“Workers and residents of long-term residential care environments will get the vaccine at their workplace. There will also be Māori and Pacific providers, pop-up centres, GPs, medical and hauora centres, community clinics and larger scale events.“An online tool that helps people find out when they can get the vaccine will be launched shortly. It describes the four broad groups and will take people through a series of questions to work out when it’ll be their turn,” Chris Hipkins said.“There are two further categories we are still looking at: one for people who may need to get a vaccine on compassionate grounds; and a national significance category, which could include groups who need a vaccine in order to represent New Zealand overseas.“Decisions around these categories will be made at Cabinet in coming weeks.”","Publication Date: 10 March 2021

Big vaccination drive leading to a National Day of Action on October 16,"With over half the eligible population now fully vaccinated and more than 80% with at least one dose, we’ve all got to do our bit reach the remaining 20%, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says“We’ve got a plan and to make it work we’re asking everyone to contribute to a big, nationwide push for vaccination. This will culminate in a National Day of Action for vaccination on Saturday 16 October,” Chris Hipkins said.“On that day, we will have vaccine clinics open throughout Aotearoa all day and into the evening. A bit like Election Day, we will be asking all our political and civic leaders to contribute to a big collective effort to turn people out.”As of today half of the eligible population in New Zealand has been fully vaccinated. We’ve seen 85% of Aucklanders and over 80% of New Zealanders have at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.“We all have a role to play in getting our vaccination rates up,” Chris Hipkins said.“Our message to the 80% of the eligible population who have had their first dose is this: your job is not done. Please get your second dose, and help us reach those who have not yet come forward to be vaccinated.“We need you to be talking to them about the reasons you’ve been vaccinated, we need you to make sure they are getting reliable, honest information about the vaccine. And we need you to help us to get the unvaccinated vaccinated.“We are asking our business community, our media, and our community groups to play a role too. Those that want to offer incentives to the unvaccinated to get them in the door are encouraged to do so.“We want parents and grandparents to encourage young New Zealanders to take up the opportunity to be vaccinated. We also want young people to check in with any older family members who aren’t yet vaccinated, show them where they can find reliable and accurate information online, and help the whole whānau to be protected.“We must leave no stone unturned. No one should be left behind because they haven’t had the support they need to make an informed choice to be vaccinated.”There are currently 350,000 appointments available next week onhttps://bookmyvaccine.covid19.health.nz/. That doesn’t include general practice, where more than 20% of people are getting their vaccines. Work is being done with District Health Boards now to increase capacity even further.“Our response as a collective nation to the challenges posed by COVID-19 has been world-leading. Now we need a world-leading uptake of vaccination,” Chris Hipkins said.“The next week and a half is critical. We need to pull out all the stops to increase our vaccination rates.

Final preparations to ensure Phase 1 of the vaccination rollout is ready to go,"A dry run of the end-to-end process shows New Zealand’s COVID-19 vaccination programme is ready to roll from Saturday, when the first border workers will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“The trial run took place in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch yesterday afternoon, ahead of the vaccination programme formally kicking off on Saturday,” Chris Hipkins said.“Officials have been working on logistics for months, and the dry run gave them an opportunity to stress test the system, identify any gaps and put plans in place for any event.“Inevitably, there will be some challenges with logistics as we mount the biggest vaccination campaign in our history. The system we’ve set up for phase 1 – vaccinating the border workers – is robust and flexible, but the more planning we do the better the outcome will be, as we continue to scale up the system.“Testing included things such as vaccines being dropped and technology systems being temporarily unavailable, and included the arrival of a thermal protection box used to transport the vaccine to validate the safe and secure handover process.“The final steps in preparing for the first border workers to receive their vaccines on Saturday and for the start of the overall programme, will include the vaccinators who will vaccinate the border workers receiving the vaccines themselves. This will take place tomorrow,” Chris Hipkins said.“While our workforce modelling shows we only need 100 vaccinators to immunise everyone who works at our border, we already have more than that who have completed the necessary training to administer the Pfizer vaccines, and hundreds more set to complete it in coming weeks.”","Publication Date: 18 February 2021

Government response to independent Pharmac Review,"The Government has released its response to the recommendations of the final report of the independent Pharmac Review panel, welcoming its insights as well as Pharmac’s commitment to improve in its role for better health equity and outcomes for all New Zealanders.“We madean election promiseto conduct an independent review to look at how well Pharmac performs against its objectives, and whether those objectives need changing,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.“Securing the health of New Zealanders is a key priority for our Government. Ensuring Pharmac is working well as part of the total health system has been part of our plan.“In Budget 22 we made the largest single contribution to Pharmac’s Medicines budget ever bringing total funding to $1.2 billion. This has already seen Pharmac launch consultations on proposals to fund medicines for conditions including cancer and multiple sclerosis.“Our drug-buying system was set up nearly three decades ago and with the new health system ready to get to work come July 1, we knew it would be sensible to look at how well Pharmac is doing and ensure it is aligned with the principles of our health system rebuild.“Pharmac’s purpose is to secure the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment from within the amount of funding provided.“The panel found Pharmac’s model has delivered significant benefits, but to achieve its purpose these benefits need to be shared more equitably across our communities, especially for Māori and Pacific peoples,” Andrew Little said.“As a result of this Review, Pharmac will have a much greater focus on improving the health of Māori, Pacific peoples, disabled people and other groups who do not yet share equitably in the benefits Pharmac provides.“This will mean stronger relationships with Māori to honour te tiriti o Waitangi, that Pharmac is more inclusive of people with health needs, and explains its work more openly for the public.“The Pae Ora Bill will put into action many aspects of the recommendations made by the Review Panel to be more collaborative, engaging and equity focused.“Pharmac has confirmed to me that it accepts the Panel’s findings. Pharmac is committed to making the needed strategic and operational changes, and already has work underway to do this.“The panel made 33 recommendations and the government agrees in principle with most of them. There is a small number of recommendations where the government takes a different view, for example where the health reforms will address the underlying issues now or in the future,” Andrew Little said.“The main change is that Pharmac will be required to engage more with health consumer voices and to more actively collaborate and co-ordinate with other parts of the health administration.“For example, developing a vaccine strategy is not just a matter of good procurement but needs to take account of a broader range of objectives which the Ministry of Health must be integrally involved with.”Please see the sidebar for the Government's Response and the Final Independent Review Report.","Publication Date: 1 June 2022

Aviation support extension provides runway for recovery,"The Government has extended support for the international aviation sector to maintain international passenger services, remain connected with important trade partners and support the economic recovery, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced today.“The Maintaining International Air Connectivity (MIAC) scheme was due to end on 31 October 2021, but we have extended it to 31 March 2022 to help with demand over the peak summer cargo season,”Michael Wood said.“Extending the MIAC scheme gives us regular international air services for passengers and freight, and also protects our links to critical supplies like vaccines and medicines.It ensures we have the capability required for our businesses to tap into international markets and support our recovery.“Since May 2020, temporary Government support has enabled more than 8,800 flights carrying over 169,000 tonnes of airfreight worth around $13.5 billion. During the same period, nearly 85,000 people have returned to New Zealand on supported flights – 45 per cent of the total number of people to pass through MIQ facilities.“When the pandemic first began, New Zealand could have been cut off from regular air services to the rest of the world. Even now, the number of passenger flights into New Zealand is only a quarter of its pre-COVID levels and many of those planes carry very few passengers, which shows how critical MIAC is for keeping us connected currently.“Te Manatū Waka Ministry of Transportis working with airlines to confirm the routes and services which will be supported over summer. I expect the exact schedule of services under the MIAC extension will be finalised over the coming weeks.“Going forward, we will reduce the level of support we provide as the Reconnecting New Zealanders strategy is implemented and border restrictions begin to ease. We expect to be able to wind down the scheme and are beginning work on how we will make this transition in a way that provides certainty and ensures that critical freight continues to flow,” Michael Wood said.More informationon the MIAC scheme can be found on theMinistry of Transport websiteand exporters should contact their usual freight forwarder.Support from the MIAC scheme was originally budgeted at $170 million for 1 May to 31 October 2021. In providing the extension, the Government has agreed to an additional $195 million to support flights from 1 November 2021 to 31 March 2022. There is an additional $25 million allocated to ensure that connectivity is maintained with countries we have quarantine-free travel if there are pauses or suspensions.","Publication Date: 1 October 2021

Parts of Waikato_ Northland staying at Alert Level 3,"The parts of Waikato that have been in Alert Level 3 and Northland will remain in Alert Level 3 for a few more days, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.Auckland remains at Alert Level 3, Step 1.“Based on the latest public health information, ministers have decided that maintaining the status quo in Northland and parts of the Waikato is the safest course of action,” Chris Hipkins said.“This will be reviewed by Cabinet on Monday, 18 October.“The Waikato has done a phenomenal job in getting tested and getting vaccinated. However, this morning we were informed of two new cases that are as yet unlinked to the existing cluster.“Health believes the risk from these cases – a couple – is low and there will be few locations of interest. However we need to assure ourselves that there is not undetected transmission before lowering alert levels. Genome sequencing is underway and will hopefully shed new light on these cases.“Unfortunately, we still don’t have confidence we have a full enough picture of the situation in Northland.“Getting information from the two cases who travelled around the region while infectious and are now in quarantine, remains slow going.“We may not get any further information from contact tracing interviews so are now relying on other sources of information to piece together their movements.“The best thing people in Northland can do right now is to get tested if they have symptoms of COVID-19, even if these are mild. Over the last week, more than 7000 swabs have been taken. That’s encouraging but to shift alert levels with high confidence we need even more testing over the next 5 days.“It’s also great to see Northlanders coming out to get vaccinated. There have been 19,691 vaccinations in the past seven days – that’s more than double the previous week.“It’s really important to keep this going. When we see a high level of testing and vaccination, this gives us more confidence to move down the alert levels.“Since the start of the Delta outbreak, of 158 people hospitalised, only 3 of those were fully immunised. This is the protection that the vaccine provides, and it is imperative that everyone who is eligible gets vaccinated as soon as possible.“If you have any contact with any positive cases, visited a location of interest or have any symptoms, get tested as soon as possible,” Chris Hipkins said.Key points:In Alert Level 3, you should stay home. Most people are not permitted to travel. Those who can, must carry evidence that they are permitted to travel.You can’t travel into another Alert Level 3 or Alert Level 2 area without evidence of permitted travel across boundaries.The north and south Auckland checkpoints remain in place and people need to have evidence of their permitted reason to travel ready to be checked by police. Most people permitted to travel out of the Auckland region will need evidence of a COVID-19 test.Police are out in force patrolling the Waikato Alert Level 3 boundary. Those who are permitted must carry evidence that they are permitted to travel.At every airport in the Alert Level 3 areas, officials are checking that passengers have evidence of permission to travel. At Auckland Airport, most people who are permitted to travel out of the Auckland will need evidence of having a negative test.","Publication Date: 13 October 2021

Joint media release on the occasion of the meeting between European Commission President von der Leyen and New Zealand_s Prime Minister Ardern_ 30 June 2022_ Brussels,"European Commission President von der Leyen and Prime Minister of New Zealand Ardern met in Brussels on 30 June 2022. The encounter provided an opportunity to reaffirm that the European Union and Aotearoa New Zealand are longstanding partners with shared democratic values and interests, aligned positions on key international and regional issues, strong people-to-people ties, and a growing and mutually-beneficial trade and economic relationship. The leaders reaffirmed New Zealand’s and the European Union’s strong commitment to multilateralism and the rules based international order.The leaders resolutely condemned Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and reaffirmed their unwavering support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. They urged Russia to immediately stop its indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, and withdraw all its troops and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine. They also called on Belarus to stop facilitating and supporting Russia’s war of aggression. They condemned the widespread and credible reports of atrocities being committed by Russian forces, and stressed the need for ensuring accountability for the suffering and destruction in Ukraine. They called on Russia to allow immediate humanitarian access and the safe passage of all civilians concerned. They also called on Russia to immediately allow the safe return of Ukrainian individuals forcibly removed to Russia. They recalled the close coordination between the EU and New Zealand on the adoption of unprecedented sanctions against Russia and Belarus, on the diplomatic response  in multilateral organisations, and on other forms of assistance to help Ukraine. They confirmed their commitment to address, together with like-minded partners, Russia’s disinformation as well as the global consequences of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including food insecurity. In this respect, the EU and New Zealand are committed to working together to keep food and agricultural markets open and well-functioning and to strengthen global supply chains.The leaders announced the conclusion of negotiations of a comprehensive trade agreement that includes a number of ‘firsts’. The agreement will deliver important economic, commercial and broader benefits to consumers, small and large businesses and farmers in New Zealand and in the European Union as our economies deal with the ongoing impact of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The leaders welcomed the agreement’s ground-breaking commitments on trade and sustainable development, including on the Paris Climate Agreement, core labour rights, gender equality and fisheries subsidies. The two leaders also welcomed the inclusion of a new chapter on Māori Trade and Economic Cooperation. They rated highly the liberalisation of environmental goods and services related to climate change mitigation, as well as the unprecedented cooperation arrangements to improve the sustainability of our respective food systems. They committed to completing all relevant domestic procedures without delay, so that the agreement can be signed, ratified and enter into force as soon as possible. They confirmed their support to strengthening and reforming the World Trade Organization as a central pillar of the global economic system.The leaders welcomed the completion of the ratification procedure of the EU-New Zealand Partnership Agreement on Relations and Cooperation and looked forward to its imminent application to strengthen partnership on a broad range of areas, including climate change, international peace and security, research and innovation.The leaders reconfirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow, in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets within reach and to limit global warming to 1.5°C. They underscored the importance of accelerating immediately the development of concrete policies and measures at national level. To this end, they pledged to deepen and elevate the status of their dialogue and cooperation on climate change, including on climate finance and support for the adaptation and energy transition needs of vulnerable Pacific Island Countries, and to consider collaborating on support to Just Energy Transition Partnerships in Asian countries. They agreed to take joint work forward on climate change initiatives, such as the High Ambition Coalition and the Global Methane Pledge, as well as on emissions trading systems and the environmental integrity of carbon markets. They stressed the importance of tackling the biodiversity crisis and reconfirmed their commitment to reach an ambitious and transformational post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at COP15.The leaders affirmed the importance of an open, inclusive, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Further to the EU’s adoption of its Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the leaders undertook to step up coordinated engagement with the region. Both leaders stressed the importance of ASEAN centrality in the region and of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, which uphold principles such as the rule of law, openness, freedom, transparency and inclusiveness.Recognising that climate change is the single greatest threat to the livelihood and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific, the leaders confirmed that the EU and New Zealand are committed to promote a peaceful, stable, prosperous, and resilient Pacific. In line with Pacific-led priorities, they are committed to scale up coordination and respective efforts on climate action, good governance, human rights, sustainable development and security-related challenges, including in the context of the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy. They affirmed their readiness to share expertise and to provide assistance to affected countries and implement approaches to avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with climate change in the region.The leaders confirmed their commitment to cooperate on agriculture and announced that the EU and New Zealand will elevate their existing cooperation in an annual International Strategic Agriculture Dialogue focusing on shared challenges in agricultural trade and sustainability. In this respect, they pledged to share experiences and best practices in this critical area of climate action and to provide support to third countries to enhance mitigation of their agriculture emissions while improving food security.The leaders confirmed that the EU and New Zealand would continue to cooperate on ocean governance to ensure the protection and sustainable use of oceans and fisheries, including to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing wherever it occurs, as well as on seabird bycatch mitigation, biodiversity in the high seas, the establishment of new Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean, and on regulating harmful fisheries subsidies. Leaders welcomed the new WTO Fisheries Subsidies Agreement, and affirmed their commitment to complete the outstanding disciplines ahead of the WTO’s Thirteenth Ministerial Conference.The leaders acknowledged the excellent cooperation on Research & Innovation between the EU and New Zealand and welcomed the conclusion of exploratory talks between the European Commission and New Zealand on the country’s association to Horizon Europe, the EU’s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The leaders shared their expectation to see the formal negotiations launched this European autumn and concluded swiftly.With regard to COVID-19, Prime Minister Ardern acknowledged the EU’s role as the most important supplier of vaccines to New Zealand. Both leaders pledged to continue to advocate for equitable global access to and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. They also confirmed their commitment to ongoing negotiations on a new legal instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, with an empowered World Health Organization at its core.Renewing their support to the common fight against crime and terrorism, the leaders welcomed the signature today of an Agreement on the exchange of personal data between Europol and New Zealand. The agreement will strengthen law enforcement cooperation, while guaranteeing a high level of protection of fundamental rights, including data protection. Europol will be able to support the New Zealand authorities on concrete investigations, notably in fighting terrorism, organised crime, child sexual abuse and cybercrime.The leaders recalled that the EU and New Zealand promote and defend free, open, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet, the ethical and responsible deployment of digital and emerging technologies, and the realisation of human rights online, including high standards of privacy and protection of personal data. They pledged the EU and New Zealand would continue cooperation to advance responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, to address disinformation and to promote democratic resilience online.The leaders confirmed that the EU and New Zealand remain committed to addressing threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism online. They intend to continue improving their crisis response capabilities, addressing the drivers of radicalisation, including through improved transparency and management of algorithmic systems, and building an effective and diverse multistakeholder community of government, civil society and tech companies under the Christchurch Call. They look forward to attending the Christchurch Call Leaders’ Summit later this year, where they expect to make further progress on these issues.","Publication Date: 1 July 2022

Third COVID_19 vaccine_ Novavax_ approved,"New Zealanders will soon be able to access a third type of COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine will be available to people aged 18 and over, following Cabinet’s confirmation yesterday,” Chris Hipkins said.“Novavax is a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine and while the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine remains the preferred vaccine of most New Zealanders, for some people, the arrival of Novavax will be the extra incentive required to get vaccinated against COVID-19.“There’s no reason to doubt that with the introduction of Novavax, New Zealand can continue to nudge up our vaccination rates. We’re already one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world – at 95 per cent of people aged 12 and over – and we can go higher still, which will make us all safer.“The first doses are anticipated to arrive in New Zealand this month and officials are working with Novavax to confirm the delivery schedule and rollout start date.“In the meantime, work is underway to prepare for the use of Novavax in the immunisation programme. This includes workforce training and ensuring logistics measures are in place to ensure that those who want to be vaccinated with the Novavax vaccine will have this option,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 1 March 2022

Environment investments support New Zealand_s high value exports,"$17.7 million for new greenhouse gas testing and research facility$4.3 million invested in soil and grass research, including a faster hybrid breeding system for ryegrass to increase pasture resilienceBoosting on-the-ground help and advice for farmers and growers throughCareer Pathways SchemeLocking in New Zealand’s record $53 billion export revenue, and aspiring for moreThe Government has announced a suite of measures to support farmers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions while also maintaining their global competitive edge, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.“Our goal is to partner with farmers to ensure New Zealand retains its brand as a low emissions, environment friendly source of food and fibre,” Chris Hipkins said.“Farmers can’t do it all on their own and agriculture is too important for the Government not to be investing in better environmental outcomes. We want the best price for the best products, produced by the best farmers in the word – and our plan is working.“More and more people are choosing to buy products that come from a place where animals are treated well, there is a low impact on the environment and production contributes minimally to global emissions.“New Zealand farmers are already well placed to meet that demand, and this package is about the Government being at the table to help them do even better.“Markets like Europe and the UK, where we’re signing new trade deals, are the perfect places to get greater value for the products we’re exporting.“These investments in further research and development will make our farms more resilient, improve pasture productivity and reduce emissions, while also ensuring there is a local support network to help farmers right now,” Chris Hipkins said.Damien O’Connor said our primary producers made over $53 billion dollars in export earnings for the first time ever last year – and the sector is set to reach new heights again this year.“Lifting our sustainability credentials and lowering our emissions profile will be key to future-proofing the industry and cementing a path towards continued export growth,” Damien O’Connor said.“Today’s announcement, alongside industry, sees $17.7 million go towards the construction of a new greenhouse gas testing facility that will provide the permanent measuring equipment and facilities needed to support our emissions reduction plan without burdening farmers,” Damien O’Connor said.The facility is funded by the Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions, its primary sector joint venture partners, and AgResearch. Massey University in Palmerston North will supply land for the facility and cattle for testing. The new-build will include 12 respiration chambers which allow researchers to measure and monitor changes to methane emissions in individual cows.This latest project follows recent joint venture investments of $2.5 million to further work on a livestock methane vaccine, and a $1.8 million boost to develop a slow-released methane-inhibiting capsule.“The Government is also backing two new pasture projects with $4.3 million co-invested with industry through its Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures fund looking at soil and grass to help farmers reduce costs, maintain good pastures, and remain a world-leading sustainable producer of high value food,” Damien O’Connor said.“Extreme weather like repeated droughts, or the severe weather we’ve seen this year can wreak havoc on pasture and it can be slow to recover. The‘Digging deeper: Roots and resilience’project will test whether extended periods of deferred grazing will encourage pasture roots to grow larger and deeper – which in theory would increase water and nutrient use efficiency, reduce nutrient losses and increase pasture resilience to recover from extremities in the weather.“The other project,‘Ensuring a Sustainable Future Pasture Presence in NZ’,will look at increasing the productivity of pasture grass. The new ryegrass pastures under development are expected to increase productivity by around 20 percent, and provide farmers with options to reduce nitrate leaching, increase carbon sequestration and improve water use efficiency.“Demand for tools and technologies to help mitigate agricultural emissions is only increasing, both here and overseas. New Zealand can, and should, be a leader in this space and Government is investing to ensure that we stay at the cutting edge of research and development.“Through our Career Pathways Scheme we’re also backing farmers and growers on-the-ground by supporting the training of more than 40 private farm advisers alongside the establishment of the Ministry for Primary Industries’ On Farm Support team. Helping people take practical steps to reduce on-farm emissions, lift sustainability, adapt to change, and recover from events like Cyclone Gabrielle is important work.“The Government’s goal is to support farmers to do what they are already doing even better – and get the best price for it.“With record export earnings, unprecedented access through free trade agreements, and New Zealand’s current position at first in the Sustainable Trade Index, our famers are in a strong position. We need to lock in these gains and continue to strive towards a lower emissions sector providing food and fibre for the future.”","Publication Date: 14 June 2023

First COVID_19 vaccine approved,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has welcomed Medsafe’s provisional approval of New Zealand’s first COVID-19 vaccine.“The provisional approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is a positive step in New Zealand’s fight against COVID-19. It means we can now begin preparations for the first stage in our vaccination roll-out,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Medsafe provides independent advice to the Government and approves all medicines and vaccines available in New Zealand. Approval has been a very carefully considered and robust process, with safety the key priority.“Medsafe’s decision is the culmination of a rigorous assessment process over many months to ensure the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is safe and effective to use here. It is informed by the most up to date medical and scientific data. We can have confidence in their decision.“They’ve been in regular contact with medicines regulators around the world where the vaccine is already being rolled out. Allowing some time to study the vaccine roll-out overseas has provided extra assurance before starting our vaccination programme here.“New Zealand is in a fortunate position in not having any current community outbreaks or transmission of COVID-19. Those most at risk of getting COVID-19 will receive the vaccine first, with the broader community accessing the vaccine from the second half of the year.“Subject to expected delivery of the first batch of the vaccine, we will start vaccinating first our border workers and the people they live with. People such as cleaners, the nurses who undertake health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, airline staff and hotel workers will be among the first to get the vaccine.“Vaccinating our frontline staff will provide a critical additional line of defence to keep them well and to help prevent COVID-19 entering the community. It’s an extra layer to help protect New Zealanders and our economy against a future outbreak,” Jacinda Ardern said.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provides a green light for the first phase of the vaccination programme in New Zealand to begin.“Following Medsafe’s approval, Ministry of Health officials will give advice to the Government this week about the ‘decision to use’ the vaccine. This will essentially set out who are most suited to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, such as age ranges,” Chris Hipkins said.“We expect the first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines will arrive in New Zealand by the end of the first quarter, but we are making sure everything is in place in case there is an earlier arrival.“Once vaccination of our border workers starts, we expect it to be completed within two to three weeks.“I want to acknowledge the global efforts towards developing this vaccine and others, which have been given to millions of people around the world,” Chris Hipkins said.Jacinda Ardern said the Government will be encouraging all New Zealanders to get vaccinated.“I have said 2021 is the Year of the Vaccine. It’s a full-year programme we have only just begun. We’re not in a race to be first, but to ensure safe and timely access to vaccines for all New Zealanders.“Getting vaccinated will save lives, and this is the next job of the team of five million.“We have come far in the fight against COVID; getting vaccinated is key to locking in the gains we have made and protecting our hard won freedoms.”Note to editors:Provisional consent means the pharmaceutical company must meet certain conditions, including supplying more data from its clinical trials around the world as they progress. This will happen at the same time as the vaccine is rolled out.Provisional approval is not uncommon, for instance the annual influenza vaccine is given provisional approval for the same reason.","Publication Date: 3 February 2021

Another COVID_19 drug in the medicine chest,"Health Minister Andrew Little says New Zealanders who contract COVID-19 now have access to six medicines proven to safely prevent the most severe and life-threatening symptoms of the virus.Andrew Little was in Auckland this afternoon to see the first shipment of molnupiravir, the second oral anti-viral COVID-19 medicine to arrive in the country.“Anti-virals stop people with mild COVID-19 symptoms from becoming very sick and needing to go to hospital, and because they are pills, they are easy for people to take at home,” Andrew Little said.New Zealand was one of the first countries to secure access to supplies of molnupiravir. It was approved this month by medicines regulator Medsafe, and the first shipment has just arrived.“Vaccination is still our first and best line of defence, but it is important to have a range of treatments available for people who contract COVID-19 and are at risk of becoming seriously ill,” Andrew Little said.“We already have four medicines – Baricitinib, Ronapreve, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab – being used in hospitals, and this month another anti-viral, Paxlovid, started being used to treat people at home.“Adding molnupiravir into the mix means doctors have got a range of medicines to combat the worst symptoms of COVID-19 and protect people who are immunocompromised or have complex health conditions. It also helps prevent the health system from being overwhelmed,” Andrew Little said.Another medicine, Evusheld, a prophylactic treatment which can prevent people who can’t have vaccines from getting COVID-19, is awaiting Medsafe approval.All COVID-19 medicines are funded through the Government’s COVID-19 fund.","Publication Date: 28 April 2022

Foreign Minister to take part in ASEAN_related meetings,"Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta will today begin a suite of meetings with her ASEAN and East Asia Summit counterparts, starting with the 11th East Asia Summit (EAS) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting tonight. That will be followed by the ASEAN-New Zealand Ministerial Meeting on Thursday 5 August and the 28th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) on Friday 6 August, which brings in a number of additional partners from across the Indo-Pacific. All the meetings are via videoconference.“These annual meetings are of significant importance to New Zealand as we look to re-engage with the world,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“ASEAN’s ability to bring a range of important players together is critical for finding solutions to a range of regional issues that call for regional solutions. Key among them in 2021 are COVID-19, the need for equitable access to vaccines and how to support an inclusive and sustainable, green economic recovery.“Aotearoa New Zealand’s participation in the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum are important for their focus on the key political, economic and security issues of interest to the eighteen members of the EAS and the twenty seven members of the ARF,” said Nanaia Mahuta. She said that New Zealand’s major policy priorities for these meetings will be the pandemic, Myanmar, and maritime issues.“We want to show solidarity with Indo-Pacific states as we tackle the challenges posed by Covid-19, and I will also be urging action on Myanmar. In addition, the tensions in the South China Sea continue to be a concern for New Zealand as they are for others,” said Nanaia Mahuta.Last year New Zealand celebrated 45 years of relations with the ASEAN bloc.  The breadth of New Zealand’s cooperation with ASEAN reinforces the importance of partnerships across the region to advance Aotearoa’s strategic interests. The Minister noted that ASEAN has underpinned decades of regional peace and stability to New Zealand’s benefit and the partnership therefore continues to be vital.“ASEAN’s ten member states together comprise New Zealand’s fourth largest trading partner, accounting for 10% of our total goods exports. Economic cooperation with ASEAN extends beyond its value as an export market, as ASEAN will be a key partner for our economic recovery both as a trading partner and an advocate for upholding the multilateral trading system,” Nanaia Mahuta said.ENDS","Publication Date: 4 August 2021

We have already seen the important impact it can make through the development of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 to protect those who live here in Aotearoa New Zealand,” Megan Woods said.“There is also a lot of potential to produce new vaccines, treatments and diagnostics that support wellbeing and better health outcomes in other areas such as cancer, and autoimmune and neurological disorders.“RNA technology offers an opportunity to develop applications in animal health, agriculture and aquaculture. This investment is especially important to build our ability domestically to respond to future pandemics should we need to.”An investment of $40.7 million over four years will allow New Zealand to:develop its emerging strengths in this field, identify and address gaps in terms of capability and create high value jobsbridge engagement between researchers and industry partners to test and commercialise new approachessupport clinical testingfacilitate linkages with partners and institutions overseas.“New Zealand has incredible researchers and innovators. Through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how research and science have been vital to minimise the impact of the virus on our whānau.“An RNA platform will help put New Zealand researchers at the forefront of global efforts by increasing domestic and international collaborations. We want to make sure that New Zealand starts investing in this now, bringing together key players across the industry, and unlocking and developing international relationships. This will complement the investment the Government has already made in managing infectious disease,” Megan Woods said.“On occasion New Zealand needs vaccines that can’t be sourced from global suppliers, such as for meningococcal disease or rheumatic fever. Having domestic RNA capability will help us better respond to the health needs of New Zealanders,” Ayesha Verrall said.The RNA platform will be run through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Strategic Science Investment Fund.","Publication Date: 19 May 2022

APEC trade ministers_ unite on COVID_19 vaccine steps and rejuvenating the WTO,"APEC trade ministers today committed to speeding up the cross-border flow of vaccines and related goods to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.Thisfollowed the completion of the APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade Meeting chaired by Minister for Trade and Export Growth Damien O’Connor early this morning.“As we face the biggest health and economic crisis of our lifetimes, I was greatly heartened to see how we united to make progress. We represent half of global GDP and wanted to use trade as a force for good,” Damien O’Connor said.“We know nobody is safe until everybody is safe from COVID-19, and we know that our region prospers economically by keeping our markets open to one another rather than closing ourselves off. APEC Trade Ministers today agreed to:Act now to speed the flow of vaccines and vaccine-related goods by eliminating trade restrictions that increase the cost of vaccines and the goods that support them;A set of guidelines for  their Customs authorities to ensure vaccines flow through ports and airports as quickly as possible so they are not sitting idle;Remove barriers to freight and logistics services to support trade in vaccines and vaccine-related goods to help fight the pandemic.”“It is encouraging to see APEC trade ministers working together to respond in practical, concrete terms to the COVID pandemic and rebuild our economies,” he said.Minister of State for Trade and Export Growth, Phil Twyford, who represented New Zealand at the meeting, said APEC had returned to its traditional role of championingmultilateralismby:Rejuvenating the World Trade Organisation and injecting momentum into a series of trade negotiations with the aim of concluding these by the end of this year.Doubling down on a sustainable recovery by pushing the World Trade Organisation to agree governments should not pay subsidies that encourage over-fishing and to finish their negotiations by the end of July.Starting to reform subsidies to the fossil fuel industry that are contributing to the climate crisis.“I would also like to acknowledge the important work led by Minister of Customs Meka Whaitiri and the New Zealand Customs Service to publishtheBest Practice Guidelines for APEC Customs Administrations.“This was a New Zealand-led APEC initiative, which is intended to help fast track the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines so they aren’t held up at borders and are distributed to people in a safe and timely manner,” Phil Twyford said.View the APEC Ministers Responsible for Joint Trade Statement 2021View Annex 1: The APEC Statement on COVID-19 Vaccine Supply ChainsView Annex 2: The APEC Statement on Services to Support the Movement of Essential Goods","Publication Date: 6 June 2021

Independent experts to advise Government on post_vaccination future,"The Government is acting to ensure decisions on responding to the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic are informed by the best available scientific evidence and strategic public health advice.“New Zealand has worked towards an elimination strategy which has been successful in keeping our people safe and our economy in good shape,” Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said.“One of our strengths has been our commitment to constantly learn and adapt.“The next phase of the pandemic poses significant challenges, including the emergence of new variants, but it also provides us with new opportunities,” Chris Hipkins said.“As the COVID-19 vaccine programme ramps up in the second half of the year, the Government will face a number of decisions regarding our border and public health settings,” Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall said.“A strategic public health advisory group has been set up to provide independent advice and analysis to the Government, informed by their expertise in epidemiology, infectious diseases, public health, and modelling on these future decisions.“The Government will be seeking their advice on issues such as how much of our population needs to be vaccinated before we can relax our border settings, evidence for transmission blocking properties of the vaccine, strategic public health controls when the borders reopen and public health responses to any new variants that aren’t covered by our current vaccine options.“The Ministry of Health will support the Group’s work and share any information that would be useful to them. The Group will work alongside Sir Brian Roche’s COVID-19 Independent Continuous Review, Improvement and Advice Group, especially around health protections post vaccine.“The members will also have a public facing role. Once advice has been considered, they will need to communicate the science behind any changes to New Zealand’s border settings,” Dr Ayesha Verrall said.The Group will report to the Minister for COVID-19 Response, Chris Hipkins via Associate Minister of Health (Public Health) Dr Ayesha Verrall, who will be meeting the members regularly.The Group’s chaired by Professor Sir David Skegg, and made up of the following members:Dr Nikki TurnerProf Philip HillDr Maia BrewertonProf David MurdochDr Ella IosuaRodney Jones (Special Advisor)Shaun Hendy (Special Advisor)Observer:Dr Ian Town“Sir David is a highly respected epidemiologist and public health physician.

Technical amendment to Medicines Act,"The Government is aware of a High Court decision today about processes to grant provisional consent to some approved medicines, and is making a technical amendment to modernise the law.The Court has said that while the Minister of Health can, under Section 23 of the Medicines Act, grant approval for Medsafe-approved medicines to be used by a limited number of patients, it’s arguable whether it can be done for the whole population.Health Minister Andrew Little says Section 23 has been used over 40 years by successive Governments to grant early access to approved therapeutic substances when it is in the public good.“The law has for some time now, lacked clarity over how it can be applied,” Andrew Little said.“We already knew the Medicines Act was out of date, which is why we were planning to replace it with a new Therapeutic Products Act.“Treatments approved under Section 23 go through a rigorous Medsafe approvals process. There are occasions when the health needs of a population call for urgent access to a medicine, vaccine or treatment and we need to keep this option available for some circumstances.“There are six products currently in use under Section 23, including two types of contraceptives, two pandemic flu vaccines, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and an electrolyte solution used in hospitals, potentially affected by the decision.“The Government will introduce a Bill tomorrow to make sure New Zealanders continue to have timely access to the medicines and treatments they need. The Medicines Amendment Bill is expected to be passed under urgency tomorrow in order to protect New Zealanders early access to medicines when needed,” Andrew Little said.The Therapeutic Products Bill that will replace the outdated Medicines Act is expected to be introduced into Parliament next year.","Publication Date: 18 May 2021

Government accelerates efforts to support disabled peoples vaccination experiences,"Launch of‘The Manaakitanga Journey’tool to help disabled people get vaccinated against COVID-19Aone-stop shop online containing COVID-19 information, with accessible format considerations, and locations of Super Accessible Vaccination sites.A new tool that supports disabled people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was launched today as the country gets closer to reaching the 90 percent vaccination milestone, Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni announced.The Manaakitanga Journey is a graphic online tool that packages up key information on theUnite Against COVID-19website such as how to book New Zealand Sign Language interpreters at clinics, and how to arrange transport to and from your vaccination appointment.“Getting a vaccination is the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your community – and we want all New Zealanders to have the right support to get the job done,” Carmel Sepuloni said.“That’s why we’ve been working with the disability sector and community, Office for Disability Issues, the Ministry of Health and DHBs to develop services and information that ensures disabled people are aware of their eligibility in the vaccine programme.“Deciding whether to be vaccinated, finding the most appropriate site and place to be vaccinated at and who to contact if you need transport, are all key parts of the journey that can often affect disabled people’s experiences. This makes that process easier,”One in four New Zealanders identify as disabled or having an impairment. As of the 27th of October, of the 30,522 people supported by the Ministry of Health’s Disability Supports Services nationwide, 82 percent have had their first dose, and 67 percent have been fully vaccinated.“The vaccination programme aims to be inclusive and accessible to all New Zealanders so that all people have the opportunity and access to a vaccination site. DHBs and local providers are really committed to getting it right for disabled people to ensure they can access the vaccine in a way that meets their needs in their local area.“We’re continuing that momentum with the launch of a disability-specific part of the Unite Against COVID-19 website, which will be updated weekly with Super Accessible sites and centres for disabled people to get vaccinated at across the motu.TheUnite Against COVID-19 websitewill also contain consolidated information specifically for disabled people and those who have underlying health conditions, such as supported decision making, a list of accessible vaccination centres near you, arranging transport and information in alternative formats.“I believe The Manaakitanga Journey captures the essence and importance of removing barriers to vaccination for disabled people, making it more accessible and inclusive, and as we continue to protect and look out for all New Zealanders,” Carmel Sepuloni said.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will visit the Hutt Valley COVID-19 Community Vaccination Centre at 1:30pm today, to support their work as a super accessible clinic for disabled New Zealanders.","Publication Date: 28 October 2021

90 percent first dose target reached in Auckland,"Counties Manukau DHB has reached 90 percent first doses today, meaning all three Auckland DHBs have now crossed the 90 percent threshold for first doses, a key milestone on the path to Auckland opening up, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins says.Auckland DHB is at 95 percent first doses and 87 percent second doses. Waitemata DHB is 92 first doses and 83 percent second doses. Counties Manukau is now at 90 first doses and 80 percent second doses.Auckland will move across into the new traffic light system with fewer restrictions once all three DHBs have reached 90 percent fully vaccinated.“Auckland is leading the way with vaccinations, and it is exciting to see Counties Manukau reach that all important 90 percent first dose figure,” Chris Hipkins said.“Today we are an important step closer to Auckland transitioning to the new traffic light system which means restrictions will ease once each DHB is 90 percent second dose.“There’s been a huge amount of targeted work going on by local health providers to make vaccines easily accessible and to address hesitancy. It’s really pleasing to see that work paying off.“In particular the work of Māori and Pacific providers in Counties Manukau is succeeding. Getting to 90 percent first doses required pulling out all the stops in Auckland. This has included literally going door to door to ensure people are vaccinated.“Getting every DHB in Auckland up to 90 percent fully vaccinated is within our reach. On current daily rates we could be there within three weeks so long as people return for their second dose.“Everyone wants restrictions eased as soon as possible. We need to keep going and get those final second doses so we can ease restrictions with high rates of vaccination and high levels of confidence,” Chris Hipkins said.In the last 7 days, on average Auckland residents were administered 1,743 first doses, and 6,175 second doses.Of Auckland’s Māori population, 79% have received their first dose and 63% have received their second.Of Auckland’s Pacific population, 85% have received their first dose and 72% have received their second dose.","Publication Date: 7 November 2021

Booster interval reduced to three months,"A million more New Zealanders over 18 will be eligible for their booster from this Friday, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.“Cabinet has considered advice from the Director-General of Health and the COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group and decided to reduce the interval between a person’s primary vaccination course and the booster from 4 months to 3 months – starting this Friday 4 February,” Chris Hipkins said.“This is a significant step in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic as it now means a total of 3,063,823 people aged 18 and over – two thirds of our population – will be eligible for their booster from this weekend. Over 1.3 million people have already got theirs.“I urge every New Zealander who is eligible for a booster to get it as soon as possible. We are in a race against Omicron and the more people who are boosted the more we can reduce the impact of the outbreak.“Bringing forward the booster timing will help those who have been immunised more recently. It will mean more people, especially Māori, will be able to receive a booster before Omicron takes hold in communities.“Boosters lower your chances of getting very sick from the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and ending up in hospital. Fewer hospitalisations from COVID-19 will mean our health systemcan continue to provide the full range of care people need, in particular for our most vulnerable such as people with disabilities or long-term illnesses.“It is also important to reduce impacts on other workforces such as those involved with the supply chain to ensure people have access to goods and services.“New Zealand is in the top 10 most highly vaccinated countries in the OECD – 94 percent of us aged over 12 are fully vaccinated. That’s close to four million New Zealanders, over a quarter of which have now also had their booster shot.“Now is our opportunity to build on that. We have given ourselves a head start that we cannot afford to give up.“If you are over 18 and it is three months since you received your primary vaccination course, get your booster. There is excellent capacity this weekend and in the coming weeks and enough supply throughout Aotearoa for everyone.“Thank you to our vaccination providers and staff across the country who are working the long weekend to ensure New Zealanders have options to access their booster dose, wherever they are,” Chris Hipkins said.Notes for editors:The shortened booster interval to 3 months only applies to the Pfizer vaccine. CV-TAG will provide separate advice on AstraZeneca later this month.Everyone over 18 can check when they are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzor if they have one, referring to their purple COVID-19 Vaccine appointment card or calling COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).Book your booster or find a walk-in vaccination centre atbookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Whānau bookings (group bookings for more than one person) can be made by calling 0800 28 29 26.COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be available at mobile and pop-up vaccination clinics, particularly in rural Māori communities as well as marae vaccinations where a number of kaumatua received their initial doses.Interpretation services, and text, email and NZ Relay options for deaf and hearing impaired are available if you need them on 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).

Air connectivity scheme helping recovery take off,"The Government has awarded a new round of airline support contracts through to the end of October 2021 to help keep New Zealand connected internationally and positioned for recovery, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced today.Michael Wood said the Government moved quickly to keep critical trade flowing at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to support our economic recovery.“The previous International Airfreight Capacity (IAFC) scheme was restructured in March this year to focus on staying connected with international partners and our recovery. It allows for support levels to reduce as passenger numbers rise.“Airfreight capacity is at 90 per cent of pre-COVID levels thanks to the previous scheme and its successor Maintaining International Air Connectivity (MIAC) scheme, which have helped keep trade channels open and maintain supply of time-critical goods like medicine into New Zealand.“Since May last year, Government support has enabled more than 7,000 flights carrying over 136,000 tonnes of airfreight worth around $10 billion.“The scheme has also been critical for our Pacific partners – it recently supported the delivery of nearly 200,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu through the COVAX Facility.“Nearly 75,000 people have returned to New Zealand on flights supported by the scheme – 53 per cent of the total number of people to pass through MIQ facilities. It’s unlikely those journeys or the freight moved would have been possible without it.“New agreements have been reached with Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui, Korean Air, and China Airlines to maintain airfreight capacity with key international partners. The Ministry of Transport is negotiating with a number of other carriers and further announcements will be made in the coming weeks.“There was a very real possibility New Zealand could have been effectively cut off from the rest of the world. Extending support to October protects our links with the rest of the globe and gives a regular schedule of air services for passengers and freight.“Securing our recovery is a key focus for the Government and we are carefully watching the international aviation market. We will consider extending support beyond October to a final date of March 2022 if necessary,” Michael Wood said.Based on forecast demand for the MIAC scheme, the Government has agreed to an additional $170 million in support to October 2021, which will be drawn from the COVID-19 support package.More information on the IAFC and MIAC schemes can be found on theMinistry of Transport websiteand exporters should contact their usual freight forwarder.","Publication Date: 27 May 2021

First step in managed isolation changes_ expanding QFT with Pacific,"Halving of time overseas arrivals spend in MIQ facility to seven days followed by home isolation until they return a negative day 9 test, from 14 NovemberExpanded quarantine free travel for eligible one-way travellers from some Pacific nations, from 8 NovemberPhased easing of border restrictions will see home isolation increasingly used for vaccinated overseas arrivals in Q1 2022The Government is starting a phased easing of border restrictions that will see the time spent in an MIQ facility halved for overseas arrivals from 14 November and home isolation introduced in the first quarter of 2022 at the latest, Chris Hipkins said today.It is also expanding one-way quarantine free travel with some Pacific nations in the first step in the Government’s phased plan to carefully reconnect New Zealand with the world.“MIQ has served us well. Over 183,000 New Zealanders have returned home through MIQ since border restrictions were put in place last year, stopping cases at the border and allowing us to live life free of restrictions for the better part of 18 months,” Chris Hipkins said.“When MIQ was introduced we didn’t have the vaccine so every arrival posed a high level of risk. With most people returning now fully vaccinated the risk profile of international arrivals has changed so it is time to start changing our MIQ settings.“Last week the Government announced a pathway forward out of lockdowns with the new traffic light COVID-19 ProtectionFramework that will see an easing of restrictions once the country is 90 percent vaccinated. Today’s easing of MIQ requirements is part of our broader plan to re-openNew Zealand safely and reconnect with the world.“The first change we are making is halving the length of time international arrivals will need to stay in MIQ to seven days. Advice is this is the lowest risk change as the vast majority of border cases we pick up within the first seven days.“The vast majority of COVID-19 cases are picked up within the first three days of MIQ. Positive cases from border arrivals are increasingly rare, at 2 or 3 per 1000, and there’s a 1 in 2000 rate of positive test results in MIQ after day seven. In addition, full vaccination will be required for all non-New Zealand travellers from 1 November.“Arrivals will be tested on day 0/1, day 3, and day 6/7 testing, followed by a short period of self-isolation at home – around three days.“A rapid antigen test and health checks will be carried out on day seven before a person leaves MIQ, and people will get a PCR test on day 9 of their home isolation and stay at home until the result comes back.“This evolution of MIQ will initially free up more than 1500 rooms a month. These spaces will enable two things; they’ll allow rooms to continue to support the Auckland outbreak and some additional rooms will be available and will add to the vouchers being released next week.“Shortened stays in MIQ were part of our international reconnecting plan announced shortly prior to the Auckland Delta outbreak. The move to ensure returnees are vaccinated and additional data on Delta have enabled these changes to be bought forward.“The second stage of our plan will see New Zealand moving towards having more vaccinated people able to self-isolate at home instead of in MIQ.“This option will be made available to increasing numbers of fully vaccinated travellers in the first quarter of 2022. However our priority at this stage is to safely transition to the new traffic light system first and bed that in before adding the additional risk of international arrivals immediately entering the community.“When the COVID-19 Protection Framework is bedded in, 90 per cent of eligible New Zealanders will be fully vaccinated so we will have a higher level of confidence than we do right now of allowing international arrivals to go straight into the community.“A phased approach also gives us time to evaluate the technology that’ll be used to monitor home isolation compliance in the business home isolation pilot, which starts at the end of this month.“Fees, exemption and exception frameworks and isolate at home guidelines will be updated during the next three weeks. From 14 November, the self-isolation period for business travellers in the pilot will also be shortened to 10 days.Expansion of one-way quarantine-free travel with parts of the Pacific“We’re also expanding one-way quarantine free travel from Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu to include travellers from those countries and Tokelau who have the right to reside permanently in New Zealand and people covered by border exceptions, from 8 November.“Travellers must be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens. RSE workers are currently required to have at least one dose, and will be required to be fully vaccinated from 1 January 2022.“Due to the low risk in these countries, travellers will not need to provide a negative test before leaving or isolate on arrival in New Zealand.“Standard QFT requirements will remain in place – that is, the requirement for passengers to confirm they meet health and eligibility requirements, and to complete Nau Mai Rā. The full list of requirements will be on theUnite Against COVID-19website.“I thank the governments of these countries for their cooperation, which has led to us reaching this positive step in reconnecting our people, and the horticulture industry for the initial successful trial of QFT with Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu.“The existing quarantine free travel arrangements with the Cook Islands and Niue will be maintained.“The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, both here and abroad. We need to move quickly to make sure we’re minimising the risks we face in the best way possible. We will, as we always have, step through these changes carefully.“In the meantime, my message to all New Zealanders, whether they are here or abroad, is a very simple one. Get vaccinated. This is what will ensure we can all get back to doing the things we love and seeing those we love.”","Publication Date: 28 October 2021

It will also reassure those who are anxious about their children attending school and early learning services.“Exemptions may be possible under some circumstances.“Workers at our MIQ and at airports and ports are already required to be vaccinated.Health and Disability sector“The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Order 2021 will be updated to require anyone conducting high-risk work in the health and disability sector to be fully vaccinated by 1 December, 2021.“Under these new requirements, general practitioners, pharmacists, community health nurses, midwives, paramedics, and all healthcare workers in sites where vulnerable patients are treated (including Intensive Care Units) must receive their first dose of the vaccine by 30th October.“These requirements also include certain non-regulated healthcare work, such as aged residential care, home and community support services, kaupapa Māori health providers and Non-Government Organisations who provide health services.”The full list will be provided in the next few days.Education sector“From 1 January, 2022, schools and early learning services and providers will need to maintain a register, and ensure only vaccinated staff and support people have contact with children and students.

New Zealand donates further COVID_19 vaccines to COVAX and Pacific Islands,"New Zealand is donating further vaccines to COVAX and has commenced roll-out of Pfizer’s paediatric COVID vaccine in Polynesia, Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Associate Health Minister Aupito William Sio announced today.“Widespread vaccination saves lives. It is critical to reducing the risk of new variants emerging and setting us all on a path to recovery. Aotearoa New Zealand is committed to ensuring developing countries have access to the vaccines they need to protect against COVID-19,” Nanaia Mahuta said.New Zealand is contributing a further 7.3 million vaccines to COVAX including 5.8 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 1.5 million doses of Janssen vaccine. This brings the total volume of New Zealand vaccine donations to COVAX to 9.7 million doses.“Our latest, fully-funded dose donation to COVAX will also support vaccination programmes in developing countries, including in parts of the Pacific and in Africa where immunisation rates are low,” Nanaia Mahuta said.This donation is supported by a grant contribution of $5.1 million to cover the cost of safe injection equipment and other ancillary costs. COVAX will allocate the doses to developing countries and deliveries will commence later this month.These donations are additional to a total of $26 million in funding contributions made to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment over the last two years.“COVAX is doing vital work to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are readily available for all. Aotearoa New Zealand was an early donor to COVAX and we remain strongly supportive of their important work,” Nanaia Mahuta said.Through New Zealand’s Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with Pfizer, paediatric vaccine doses are also being provided to countries in Polynesia. The roll out of these doses has already commenced in Niue and the Cook Islands and planning is underway for donations to Samoa, Tonga and Tokelau.“We must do all we can to increase vaccine uptake everywhere, and Aotearoa New Zealand is playing its part.

Extra support to help farmers and growers affected by positive cases of COVID_19,"Farmers and growers are getting a helping hand to prepare for Omicron, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor announced today.“The Government has allocated $400,000 to support primary producers with contingency planning and response if a farmer or grower contracts COVID-19,” Damien O’Connor said.“The funding will bolster the resources of Rural Support Trusts and other organisations, including those supporting Māori agribusinesses, to help them respond to cases.“This funding will help ensure there’s someone that farmers and growers can speak to and provide guidance should they or their staff be dealing with Omicron. The Rural Support Trusts are well woven into rural communities to provide wrap around support services.“The sector has to date been resilient throughout the pandemic. The hard work of farmers and growers along with those involved in keeping supply chains open and exports flowing, is leading Aotearoa New Zealand’s trade-led recovery from COVID-19.“The latest Situation and Outlook for Primary Industries (SOPI) shows revenue from food and fibre exports is predicted to hit a record $50 billion in the year to 30 June 2022.“But the Government is committed to keeping vital workforces going. Primary producers have always been essential workers throughout the pandemic, but as Omicron reaches further into our communities, we are stepping up to ensure we can protect the wellbeing of our rural communities.“The most important thing New Zealanders can do to prepare is to get their vaccine booster dose, before Omicron takes off in the community.""Contingency planning by farmers, growers and lifestyle block owners will minimise the risk of further COVID-19 related disruptions, which can occur anywhere along the supply chain.“It’s vital all food and fibre producers have a plan. It makes it easier for other people to step in and help run your farm, or feed your livestock, at short notice,” Damien O’Connor said.“There are several free checklists available which have been developed by industry and MPI. I encourage people to make use of them.”Wage support is also available through the Leave Support Scheme for people affected during this stage of the Omicron outbreak.""This is available to employers, and also includes self-employed people, to help pay their employees who've been advised to self-isolate because of COVID and can't work at home during that period.“It's paid at the same rates as the wage subsidy was previously, that being $600 per week per full-time worker and $359 per week per part-time worker.“Our Rural Support Trusts do great work when things are at their most difficult in the provinces. Whether it’s drought, floods, or now, a pandemic.The Trusts can respond in a case-by-case basis and make sure people aren’t left isolated.

Success for Ministry at one year milestone,"The Ministry for Ethnic Communities marked its first anniversary on 1 July 2022 and celebrated a successful 12 months of influencing government policy and lifting wellbeing outcomes for ethnic communities.“The creation of the Ministry means ethnic communities finally have a Chief Executive whose sole focus is representing their concerns and aspirations at the top tables of the public service. This brings the voices of these diverse communities and their lived experiences to the fore of decision making processes,” says Minister for Diversity, Inclusion and Ethnic Communities Priyanca Radhakrishnan.“Led by Chief Executive Mervin Singham, the Ministry has focused on areas that ethnic communities told us were important. These include employment, government services that are responsive to the needs of ethnic communities, financial support for community initiatives and the response to COVID-19.‘The Ministry established a Graduate Programme that has placed skilled graduates from ethniccommunities in policy roles across government agencies. This has provided them with a meaningful first employment opportunity and enhanced diversity in policy making and the design of government services.“I am committed to improving ethnic representation on public sector boards. The Ministry’s Nominations Service maintains a database of qualified, ethnically diverse people who are seeking an appointment to a public sector board. The Ministry is now working with other partners such as the Super Diversity Institute and Leadership NZ to expand this pool of ethnic nominees and help us create a sustainable pipeline of diverse governance candidates for appointment to state sector boards.“Following a substantial increase in funding, in the year to date, the Ethnic Communities Development Fund disbursed $4.2 million in support of 310 community projects and initiatives that helped celebrate different cultures and strengthened social cohesion.“The Ministry’s work to support the government’s response to COVID-19 included working with the Ministry of Health to implement a vaccine roll out for and led by ethnic communities. This included supporting communities with translated material, running a series of community hui and commissioning a media campaign in ten languages. In addition, the Ministry administered $4 million in funding for community initiatives to support efforts to increase vaccination within their communities.“The Ministry has had a successful first year and this is just the beginning. There is a lot more to do. This Government wants to create a more cohesive Aotearoa New Zealand where everyone feels safe, valued, heard and can participate fully,” says Priyanca Radhakrishnan.“The work of the Ministry will help take us there.”","Publication Date: 6 July 2022

Early Pfizer shipment boosts vaccine schedule,"The largest shipment of the Pfizer vaccine to date has arrived into New Zealand two days ahead of schedule, and doses are already being delivered to vaccination centres around the country, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“The shipment of more than 370,000 doses reached New Zealand yesterday, following a complex logistical exercise carried out jointly by Pfizer, DHL and the Ministry of Health’s logistics team,” Chris Hipkins said.“The arrival came after some dedicated work got the vaccines onto an earlier than expected connecting freight flight from Singapore. The Ministry’s logistics team then worked through the weekend to coordinate with the flight schedule and be ready for the vaccine’s arrival into Auckland International Airport.“The shipment was processed immediately at our Auckland depot, which means deliveries could be sent smoothly and efficiently to district health board sites where the stock buffer was the smallest.“The team work also ensured everything was set up for delivery to other sites from first thing this morning.“Fifteen sites received shipments from the newly arrived stock yesterday, while 104 will receive stocks of the vaccine today, a day earlier than planned.“Teams on the ground in DHBs have been managing their stocks but towards the end of last week, margins were again getting tight in some of our larger population areas.“This big delivery – with further significant shipments to arrive during the final two weeks of July and into August – is a massive boost for the national programme.“Demand for the vaccine continues to be high, particularly in our bigger cities, and we’ve consistently said we want to have the doses out of storage and into arms.“With the rollout continuing to sit at around 6 percent ahead of plan, it’s important we continue to do everything we can to get supply out to vaccination centres as quickly as possible.“We expect this momentum to continue over the remainder of July and into August, with Pfizer having committed to deliver more than 1.5m doses into New Zealand next month.“That’ll represents our biggest monthly delivery to date and is fantastic news for the ongoing ramp up of our roll-out.“We’ll continue to manage and monitor vaccine supplies coming into the country against increasing demand as the vaccination programme gathers momentum,” Chris Hipkins said.Footage of the processing of the record delivery is available for media here:https://vimeo.com/576366810/1f5ba4d893","Publication Date: 19 July 2021

COVID_19 vaccine for urgent overseas travel,"The Government has confirmed strict criteria for early vaccinations for people who need to travel outside of New Zealand on compassionate grounds or for reasons of national significance, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.Two weeks ago the Government set out the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out plan – beginning with those most at risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 and those most at risk of getting seriously sick from it.“The Government has carefully considered circumstances where there is a genuine need for people to be vaccinated urgently in order to travel overseas,” Chris Hipkins said.“A high threshold has been set, which will balance compassion with the need to avoid potential queue jumping ahead of at-risk groups, without a strong justification. These provisions will not extend to vaccinations for new arrivals or returnees.”Even before people will be considered, they will need to satisfy a series of criteria, including being a New Zealand citizen, resident or visa holder; needing to travel before 31 August 2021; and having already made arrangements for returning to New Zealand.“People should also ensure they will be able to receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine prior to their departure,” Chris Hipkins said.The compassionate grounds that would be considered for travel overseas include:needing to provide critical care and protection for a dependant;accessing critical medical care that is not available in New Zealand; andvisiting an immediate family member who is dying.“This does not include reuniting with family, attending a funeral or memorial service, or attending a school or university.”National significance overseas travel will include representing New Zealand:in an official capacity;at significant international events; andin an official non-government capacity.“The key yardstick here is people travelling in an official capacity and ensuring their participation is in our national interest. We also expect these requests will need to be made by the appropriate agency or association on behalf of the individual, not by individuals themselves.“It does not include private or recreational travel.“The final consideration is the level of risk travellers will be exposed to COVID-19 in the destination country.“Underlying these decisions is a fundamental recognition that while where there are legitimate urgent reasons to travel overseas, it is also in all our interests to ensure New Zealanders are protected against COVID-19 to the best extent possible when travellers return home,” Minister Hipkins saidFurther information about the new criteria and application process for an advanced vaccine request will be available in the coming week, before applications open 31 March.","Publication Date: 24 March 2021

Second batch of Pfizer_BioNTech doses arrives safely _ as the first vaccinations take place in the South Island,"A second batch of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines arrived safely yesterday at Auckland International Airport, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“This shipment contained about 76,000 doses, and follows our first shipment of 60,000 doses that arrived last week. We expect further shipments of vaccine over the coming weeks,” Chris Hipkins said.“As with the first shipment, quality assurance and checks by Medsafe are underway.“By the end of March, we’re due to receive a total of about 450,000 doses – enough to vaccinate 225,000 people with a two-dose course.“The Ministry of Health is working with Pfizer/BioNTech to develop a delivery schedule for the vaccines that ensures a smooth rollout and scaling up of our immunisation programme as we rollout to the general public in mid-year.“We started our immunisation programme to around 12,000 border and managed isolation and quarantine workers last Saturday, and once completed, we’ll begin vaccinating their household contacts,” Chris Hipkins said.Meanwhile, around 40 border workers from Christchurch Airport were vaccinated this morning, the first to do so in the South Island.“This passes a milestone of the first 1000 border workers and vaccinators in New Zealand to receive their first dose. That’s a great start and we appreciate the effort of the vaccinators and border workers,” Chris Hipkins said.“They included aviation security workers, cleaners, police, customs workers and health protection officers who screen passengers arriving on international flights.“It’s pleasing to see the gradual scale up of vaccines being administered among this tier one group, as planned, as processes at each site are fine tuned. Numbers will start to pick up from here.”Chris Hipkins said a shipment of 490,000 special-purpose needles also arrived yesterday to New Zealand, which will help vaccination teams maximise safe usage of the vaccine.“Making the most of every vial of the vaccine and avoiding waste will help to ensure the successful rollout of our immunisation programme,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 24 February 2021

Aotearoa NZ responds to COVID_19 in Niue,"Aotearoa New Zealand is sending a medical team and supplies to Niue to help it respond to new cases of COVID-19, following the opening of its border to quarantine-free travel last week.Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Defence Minister Peeni Henare have announced a Medical Assistance Team will head to Niue on a NZ Defence Force C-130 Hercules tomorrow, after the Niuean government requested New Zealand support.The first quarantine-free passenger flight from New Zealand arrived in Niue on 27thJune, and positive cases were detected the following day as part of mandatory day-one testing for the passengers.“Niue has had considerable success in keeping out COVID-19. We know from our own experiences how challenging it is to deal with this virus,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“Aotearoa New Zealand has provided support to Niue since the outset of the pandemic, including economic support, assistance for its vaccine programme, support from a principal health adviser, and advice across health and border policy settings.“Niue has enviable vaccination rates. Around 99 percent of those aged over five years are double vaccinated, and 93 percent of those over 18 years are boosted. These vaccination rates will help provide a strong defence against this virus.“In line with our shared planning for a response, a public health physician from the Polynesian Health Corridors programme and a laboratory technician from Pacific Pathology Training Centre are travelling to Niue today,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“Tomorrow, a New Zealand Medical Assistance Team of doctors, nurses and logistics personnel will be deployed on the NZDF Hercules to support the Niuean health system. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and additional rapid antigen tests are also being supplied to supplement Niue’s existing stores,” Peeni Henare said.“In addition, a New Zealand Defence Force team of five personnel will also travel to Niue to provide medical planning and logistics expertise to directly support the Niuean Government’s response.“The NZDF always stands ready to work alongside our partners across the Pacific, and New Zealanders can be proud that our Defence Force will play its part as Niue responds to the increase in COVID-19 cases,” Peeni Henare said.“All New Zealand-based travellers in Niue should follow local guidance and register their details with www.safetravel.govt.nz. Tourists and business travellers to Niue are required to have travel insurance to meet costs for medical treatment and travel delays. They must stay in place if isolating. We are committed to supporting Niue as it responds to this outbreak,” Nanaia Mahuta said.","Publication Date: 5 July 2022

Govt backs business to vaccinate workforces,"Vaccination will be required for all workers at businesses where customers need to show COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates, such as hospitality and close-contact businesses.New law to introduce a clearer and simplified risk assessment process for employers to follow when deciding whether they can require vaccination for different types of work.Non-vaccinated workers in roles requiring vaccination will be given a new four-week notice period to get vaccinated before employment can be terminated.Employers to be required to provide paid time off for workers to get vaccinated and will need to keep records about workers’ vaccination status.The Government is introducing a range of measures to help protect workplaces and workers from COVID-19, Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Michael Wood announced today.“We’ve heard the calls from employers and employees to provide certainty on what roles need to be done by vaccinated workers under the COVID-19 Protection Framework,” Michael Wood said.“We’re mandating vaccination for workers at businesses where customers need to show COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates to make those workplaces as safe as possible and give confidence to staff and customers.“The timing of this coming into force will depend on when we move to the COVID-19 Protection Framework. We’re working with the CTU and BusinessNZ to make sure we will have robust guidance for businesses ready well in advance.“A number of businesses have already gone through a risk assessment process to mandate vaccinations at their workplace, but we’ve had calls from both businesses and unions to make this process as clear as possible. That’s why we will introduce a risk assessment process in law for employers to follow when deciding whether they can require vaccination for different types of work.“We know though that many businesses and employers who are not covered by vaccine certificates want greater clarity on whether they can mandate vaccines. This process will provide businesses with a clear and simplified legal framework to make decisions about requiring staff to be vaccinated or not.“This risk assessment will build on the guidance provided by WorkSafe, with input from public health officials, business representatives and unions. It will cover factors like whether a workplace involves interaction with customers.“This new process won’t override risk assessments that businesses have already done under the existing health and safety guidelines.“We know that these changes raise questions around what happens when mandated employees refuse to get vaccinated. To provide clarity, a new four-week notice period will apply if their employment is terminated if they choose not to be vaccinated and their work requires it.“Our law change will require a minimum of four weeks’ paid notice for any employee who loses their job because they are not vaccinated.“This change will only apply to employees who do not have a notice period, or whose notice periods are shorter than four weeks. Most employees will have notice periods in their employment agreement.“Employers will also be required to keep records about workers’ vaccination status.MBIE will work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to provide practical guidance on how to ensure workers’ records are handled appropriately.“We understand the urgency and we expect these changes to be in place to align with the COVID-19 Protection Framework coming into force.“We will pass this legislation as a priority to give workplaces the certainty they need, because vaccination is one of the best tools to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading,” Michael Wood said.","Publication Date: 26 October 2021

Budget boost to tackle on_farm emissions,"$37 million towards national integrated farm planning system for farmers and growers.$24 million towards agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation research and development.$900,000 to collect vital statistics on agricultural production, such as greenhouse gas emissions.The Government is backing initiatives to help reduce costs for farmers and growers, boost returns, and help achieve lower on-farm emissions.“To meet our climate change and sustainability goals we need a single national farm planning framework that is easy for farmers and growers to use and that integrates with their business requirements,” Damien O’Connor said.“A national training programme will deliver more skilled farm advisers and an accelerator fund will invest in targeted initiatives to significantly broaden the uptake of integrated farm planning.“It will ensure up to 40,000 farmers and growers have the tools they need to improve on-farm performance and meet freshwater and greenhouse gas requirements by 2025,” Damien O’Connor said.New funding will also boost research and development in technologies to reduce agricultural emissions. This could include promising areas like vaccine development, methane and nitrous oxide inhibitors, and low emissions animal breeding.“We’ve set a clear objective for agriculture in He Waka Eke Noa for 100 percent of farms to have written plans to measure and manage emissions by December 2024. As the saying goes, what gets measured, gets done.“This Budget commitment and subsequent ones by Labour will deliver lasting reductions in both agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the associated costs. We’re enabling faster development and broad uptake of new technologies on Aotearoa New Zealand farms.“New funding will also enable Aotearoa New Zealand to continue collecting vital information as part of the Agricultural Production Statistics. This includes measuring progress towards meeting our domestic and international greenhouse gas reporting and forecasting.“As an agricultural nation, there is a lot riding on our ability to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.“A key goal of ourFit for a Better World – Accelerating our Economic Recoveryroadmap launched last year is cutting biogenic methane emissions to between 24 and 47 percent below 2017 levels by 2050 – this includes reducing them to 10 percent below 2017 levels by 2030.“This new Budget investment will supercharge and streamline efforts. Getting the right result will actually add value to our exports. High-value consumers abroad want to know they’re buying food and fibre that are quality, ethical and sustainable.“Aotearoa New Zealand has to move from volume to values – that is, aligning our story with the values of our consumers,” Damien O’Connor said.","Publication Date: 20 May 2021

New Zealand to stay at Red as vaccine passes and most mandates end,"New Zealand is seeing a drop in cases, but as Omicron takes hold in our regions, public health advice tells us now is not the time for the country to move to Orange, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today.“It’s encouraging to see fewer cases. Yesterday was the lowest number we’ve seen since 25 February,” Chris Hipkins said.“Four weeks ago we were averaging around 20,000 cases a day, compared to today where that average is just over 13,000. But while the drop in cases is mainly in Auckland and Wellington, other places aren’t yet in the same position.“Hospitalisations have dropped in Auckland, but continue to plateau in regions like Canterbury, Waikato and Northland.“As a result, the public health advice is that it is not yet the time to ease the existing restrictions and drop down to Orange. Ministers will review these settings again next week.“We have put this check in place due to the pace at which we are seeing the COVID-19 situation changing, and acknowledging that Easter and the upcoming school holidays are an important time for businesses – particularly those in our tourist regions,” Chris Hipkins said.As we’ve learned over the last two years, keeping ourselves and each other safe from COVID-19 continues to be a team effort.“Nearly two weeks ago we announced changes to the COVID-19 Protection Framework to make it simpler and allow us to live more normal lives, while keeping the public health measures in place that we know work. We also announced changes to vaccine passes and mandates,” Chris Hipkins said.“At 11:59pm tonight, Kiwis will no longer need to use My Vaccine Pass. This was an extremely useful tool while we were getting the country vaccinated and in our fight against Delta, but with around 95% of the eligible adult population at least double dosed, we no longer need this. Businesses will still be able to use the system if they choose to but from tonight, it’s not required.“Government vaccine mandates for all sectors except health and care workers, prison staff, and border workers will be removed from tonight. They remain for health and care workers and prison staff because they come into contact with a lot of people who are at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19, and for our border workers because they are the first people who would likely be exposed to any new variant of concern that emerges internationally.“Our COVID-19 response has always prioritised the health of kiwis by ensuring we’re protecting our immunocompromised and high-risk members in our communities.“Red means wearing a face mask in most indoor settings, limiting indoor capacity to 200, and if you catch COVID-19 – or someone you live with does – isolating for 7 days.“Next to being vaccinated and having a booster, face masks are our best defence against COVID-19. Wearing them can reduce new cases of the virus by as much as 53%. That means by putting on a face mask you are contributing to lowering our case numbers, lowering the numbers of people in hospital, and lowering the number of deaths,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 4 April 2022

10 million COVID_19 vaccine doses,"Exciting milestone reached but still more to doNew Zealand has reached a milestone of 10 million COVID-19 vaccines administered, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“This afternoon at around 2pm, the 10 millionth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was administered. This has been helped by a big surge in boosters and a healthy uptake in tamariki aged 5 to 11 years old having their first paediatric dose,"" Chris Hipkins said.""The number on its own tells a great story. But it's what it signifies for the people in our country that’s the most important factor.“Ten million vaccines, including more than 1.7 million boosters, means our communities already have a good level of protection against Omicron – with more to come. Every single one of our DHBs has now reached 90 per cent of their population having received at least one vaccine dose.""Kiwis have really pulled together to protect each other with 95 per cent of people aged over 12 now fully vaccinated – one of the highest rates in the world. Sixty-one per cent of people over 18 who are due for a booster have already had one – and this is climbing quickly.“This is a major logistical achievement and the milestone is testament to the DHBs, hundreds of pharmacies, GPs, hauora, community providers and mobile clinics and other sites that have given the vaccine to everyone from our old to our young.“The advocates and workers on the ground who work with those in our hardest-to-reach communities also deserve huge recognition.“But of course, it’s the people of New Zealand who have embraced the science and put their trust in the health system who deserve the biggest accolade. They should take a bow, and then take a breath and continue to encourage others to get vaccinated.“A strong booster uptake in all our communities is our best defence against the Omicron variant. Being fully vaccinated is great, being boosted is even better.“Book your vaccine now, whether it’s your first, second or booster. Every dose counts.“The ‘Big Boost’ campaign continues this weekend, promoting the booster dose to anyone 18 and over who has had their second dose more than 3 months ago.“Many vaccination centres will be open extended hours over the weekend to encourage people to get their booster,” Chris Hipkins said.Find a vaccination centre near you by visiting BookMyVaccine.nz or calling the Covid Vaccination Healthline on 0800 28 29 26 for a whānau booking.The 10 million doses is made up of 4,011,194 first doses, 3,939,188 second doses, 39,717 third primary doses for immunocompromised people, 1,722,179 boosters, and 204,796 paediatrics doses.","Publication Date: 11 February 2022

Extending support for the COVID_19 elimination strategy to June 2022,"Funding to support the COVID-19 health response and quarantine facilities for a further 18 monthsMoney drawn down from the COVID-19 contingency fundFurther improvements to health response administration and governanceLessons learned on surveillance and testingThe Government has set aside extra funding to support the health system’s COVID-19 response and to maintain quarantine facilities up to June 2022, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said today.“We are committed to continuing our sustained approach of keeping COVID-19 out, preparing for it, and stamping it out, for as long as it takes, and have funded that for another 18 months if needed,” Chris Hipkins said.“As we move into 2021 there are exciting developments on the vaccine and safe travel zone fronts. But we also need our health system to have sufficient capacity and support to maintain effective levels of contact tracing and testing, and for managed isolation and quarantine facilities to be fully resourced for our overall elimination strategy to work.“That requires cash injections for the Ministry of Health, DHBs and agencies working at the quarantine facilities to provide funding certainty.”Funding agreed by Cabinet will pay for a series of COVID-19-related health activities to June 2022, including:Maintaining up to 7000 tests a day including swabbing and laboratory services.Contact tracing, supplies of PPE and supporting technology.Additional support for the Ministry, and for DHBs on an as-needed basis.The additional funding of $1.12 billion adds to the $251 million injection provided to health in October.Further additional funding of $1.74 billion, split across the agencies involved, will ensure the MIQ operating model is fully resourced up to June 2022, including the costs of accommodation, transport, food, security and health and wellbeing services.“These are significant investments that are critical to keeping our defences strong. Keeping COVID-19 out and quickly managing any incursions that do occur is an expensive business but it’s the best investment we can make for our health and our economy,” Chris Hipkins said.“As well as continuing high levels of frontline delivery, the extra health funding will enable the Ministry to enhance its oversight and policy roles and other activities through a new COVID-19 Response Directorate and to continue to make improvements to the way it operates. That includes a focus on improved Information Technology.“New functions being developed include a greater role in research, more capacity to undertake infection, prevention and control audits and a beefed up policy and strategy unit,” Chris Hipkins said.Further improvements to the response administration and governance“Throughout our response to COVID-19 so far, we’ve adopted a mind-set of driving constant review and improvement in the face of an unpredictable and fast evolving situation,” Chris Hipkins said.“The system of multiple interconnected agencies and portfolios is complex but has stood up well overall. Continual improvements have and continue to be made – but making substantial changes at the same time as focusing on keeping COVID-19 out has been a challenge.“With much-improved testing, contact tracing and border control now in place however, the Government is in a position to consolidate and strengthen administration and governance of the response.“This is increasingly essential to meet the added complexity of keeping New Zealanders safe, implementing the biggest immunisation programme in our history, while further stimulating the economy and managing a staged opening of our borders.”The updated approach, to be in place by March 2021, involves:Strategic leadership and central coordination to be led by a COVID-19 Response unit, building on existing all-of-government functions in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.The public health response, including strengthened surveillance and testing, and public health advice, to be managed by the Ministry of Health.End-to-end management of our borders, including links to MIQs, led by a Border Executive Board of interdepartmental chief executives.Lessons learned and progress on surveillance, testing and contact tracingIn August, the Government established an Advisory Committee, chaired by Sir Brian Roche and Heather Simpson, to review testing and surveillance systems and propose improvements. This was followed in October by a review of contact tracing performance, also led by Sir Brian Roche.“The reports are independent and between them contain 28 recommendations, of which 25 are for the Ministry of Health,” Chris Hipkins said.“Overall, the Committee found that by the time the reports were being written, the required improvements, including border testing, were under way.“Cabinet has this week considered an update from the Ministry and other agencies on progress against the recommendations. Actions on five of the recommendations have been completed, with 23 underway.“The Ministry has all year been at the heart of a massive response to a global pandemic that a year ago no-one could have foreseen,” Chris Hipkins said.“It has continued to improve and adapt its response to COVID-19, while delivering on its many other obligations. New Zealanders should have confidence in the containment of recent community cases to date as a result of a stronger Ministry response and the hard work of public health units,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 18 December 2020

Government sets out plan to reconnect New Zealanders to the world,"Vaccination rollout will speed up, with all eligible ages able to book in their vaccine by 1 SeptemberMove to 6 weeks between doses to ensure more NZers at least partially vaccinated as soon as possible in face of Delta riskPhased approach to reopening border with self-isolation pilot this year and set up of new testing and vaccine checking systems at borderFrom the first quarter of 2022 move to new individual risk based border settings that will establish low, medium and high risk pathways into the countryElimination retained as best strategy to keep COVID out and economy openThe Government will use the second half of 2021 to vaccinate as many New Zealanders as possible and safely conduct a self-isolation trial for vaccinated New Zealanders in order to prepare for a phased resumption of quarantine-free travel, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.The Government’s framework for re-opening borders and moving to an individualised risk-based model for quarantine-free travel was unveiled at a forum on Reconnecting New Zealanders to the World in Wellington today. The release of the plan followed the publication of Sir David Skegg’s Strategic COVID-19 Public Health Advisory Group’s advice to Government on Wednesday.“Getting vaccinated is the number one thing everyone can do to be protected against COVID-19, help accelerate our economic recovery, reduce the risk of lockdowns, and safely allow New Zealand’s borders to begin re-opening next year,” Jacinda Ardern said.“The plan announced today is informed by the best available scientific evidence and public health advice. It will allow us to capture the opportunities vaccination brings, while protecting the gains New Zealanders have worked so hard for.“Key to this is maintaining our Elimination Strategy. The advice is clear: If we open our borders now we will lose the freedoms and advantages we have achieved so far.“If we give up our elimination approach too soon there is no going back, and we could see significant breakouts here like some countries overseas are experiencing who have opened up early in their vaccination rollout.“Therefore the first step in our plan is speeding up the vaccination process to ensure everyone is at least partially vaccinated as soon as possible to reduce the risk and impact of Delta entering the country.“From today we are moving to a six week period between doses, meaning more people can get their first dose quicker and ensuring everyone is at least partially vaccinated in the coming months. Those who work at our border, have underlying health conditions or wish to be fully vaccinated sooner can still get their second dose after three weeks.“We are also bringing forward the eligibility dates for the remaining groups. As already announced 50 plus will be open from Friday 13th August, 40 plus will be open on Wednesday 18th August, 30 plus will be open on Wednesday 25th August and from 1 September we will be open for all eligible ages.“Once enough people are vaccinated, we will be able to start the next step in the plan: a phased introduction of an individual risk-based approach to border settings in 2022.“Low-Risk, Medium-Risk and High-Risk travel pathways will be created, and which pathway a traveller takes will be based on the risk associated with where they are coming from and their vaccination status.“Each pathway will have testing and isolation requirements proportionate to that risk.“The Low-Risk pathway will permit quarantine free entry for vaccinated travellers who have been in low risk countries.“The Medium-Risk pathway would include a combination of self-isolation and/or reduced MIQ for vaccinated travellers who have been in medium risk countries.“To prepare for the Medium-Risk pathway the Government will run a self-isolation pilot in the second half of this year to test processes and systems for the safe use of this tool.“Businesses and organisations that need to send staff overseas will be invited to express interest in participating in the pilot which will run between October and December 2021.“The High-Risk pathway will see the continuation of a full 14 days in MIQ and testing for unvaccinated travellers and any traveller, including vaccinated travellers, who have been in very high risk or high risk countries.“This individual risk based approach requires new systems to be set up. We will use the remainder of 2021 to continue to prepare for the operation of borders under this system.“This work includes ongoing work on the development of a traveller health declaration system, investigating new testing technology for rapid testing on arrival at airports and reliable pre-departure testing as well as piloting self-isolation arrangements for some New Zealanders and strengthening other public health measures such as contact tracing.“New Zealand remains in a strong position. We don’t have COVID in the community and our economy is more open than most.“Our plan to reopen our borders both protects the gains we have won, while setting us up to safely reconnect New Zealanders and business with the world and seize the opportunities created by our COVID success,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 12 August 2021

Financial support to move to traffic light system,"A new transition payment will be made available particularly for affected businesses in Auckland, Waikato and Northland to acknowledge the restrictions they have faced under the higher Alert Levels.Transition payment of up to $24,000 as businesses move into traffic light systemLeave Support Scheme and Short Term Absence Payment available under new frameworkFurther targeted support will be considered once framework beds inRSP adjusted to support recently acquired businesses“The one-off transition payment will be activated through the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) system criteria and be available on December 10,” Grant Robertson said.This payment is at a higher base rate than the current RSP and will be $4,000 per business plus $400 per FTE up to a cap of 50 FTEs – a maximum payment of $24,000. Treasury has estimated the likely total cost of the payment to be between $350 and $490 million.The affected revenue period for the Transition Payment will be set between October 3 and November 9, and must be compared to a typical week in the six weeks prior to August 17.This payment is a recognition of the long period of time businesses in Auckland in particular have spent with restrictions in place prior to shifting to the new framework.“As I said last month we are moving away from the broad based economic supports provided under the Alert Level system. This is because at all levels of the new framework, most businesses will be able to operate at almost full capacity,” Grant Robertson said.“On Friday the final Wage Subsidy and RSP opened for applications. These will still open, and pay out even though we are moving to the new framework, in addition to the transition payment.“Support to be off work while isolating or to take leave while waiting for test results, currently provided by the Leave Support Scheme (LSS) and the Short Term Absence Payment, will remain available under all levels of the traffic light system.“However, the LSS will move to a weekly payment rather than fortnightly under the new system, reflecting the changed isolation period.“We will monitor any economic impacts the new system may be having on businesses. I expect to report back to Cabinet in early 2022 on this and will make recommendations for support as necessary.“To be clear about this, if it is deemed necessary targeted support would only be available under the Red setting of the new system as businesses that operate vaccine passes have no significant restrictions at Orange and Green.Cabinet has also agreed to change the rules so recently acquired businesses can access the Resurgence Support Payment.“This issue arose because the RSP rules required the applicant to have been operating as a business for at least one month before August 17 so businesses acquired after July 17 have not been eligible for any payment.“I estimate very few businesses have will been in this situation, but for those that are, it will have been a difficult time.“The test will now be that the business itself must have been in operation for at least one month prior to August 17 and the business must be carrying on the same or similar activity as before the change in ownership.“The revenue decline test also needs to be amended to allow the applicant to use the revenue received by the previous owner over the comparator period in order to demonstrate the necessary revenue decline during the affected period,” Grant Robertson said.The change will come into effect on December 10 and recently acquired businesses would then be eligible for RSPs made on and after October 29.","Publication Date: 29 November 2021

Strengthening Trans_Tasman Ties_ Australia_New Zealand Foreign Minister Consultations,"New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon Nanaia Mahuta and Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, met in Wellington today for biannual Australia-New Zealand Foreign Minister Consultations.Marise Payne’s visit is the first official visit to New Zealand by Australia since both countries imposed border restrictions in response to COVID-19 in March 2020.The Ministers welcomed the chance to meet in person for the first time, following the commencement of two-way quarantine-free travel on 19 April.The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss ways to continue and deepen cooperation between Australia and New Zealand to meet the shared challenges facing our region.New Zealand and Australia stand together in facing a challenging global environment. Ministers discussed the importance of promoting our shared interests in an open, resilient and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They reaffirmed their intent to work together to preserve the liberal international order that has underpinned stability and prosperity in the region, and to foster a sustainable regional balance where all countries- large and small – can freely pursue their legitimate interests.The Ministers discussed responses to increasing pressure on the international rules-based system and rising protectionism, and agreed on the need for coordinated regional and global action on issues such as human rights and climate change, including work Australia and New Zealand are doing together to strengthen the climate resilience of our Pacific island partners.The Ministers also highlighted the importance of strengthening gender equality, including promoting women in leadership in the Pacific and initiatives on sexual and reproductive health and rights.Minister Payne and Minister Mahuta agreed on the value of coordinating with other likeminded countries and building broad coalitions on issues of common interest.Ministers also reiterated both governments’ commitment to a resilient and united Pacific region underpinned by robust regional architecture, and to continuing to help Pacific island countries manage the health and economic impacts of COVID-19, including support for the rollout of vaccines.The two Ministers welcomed progress on the Australia-New Zealand Single Economic Market agenda. They acknowledged the contribution quarantine-free travel would make to the economic recovery in both countries, especially in the travel and tourism sectors. The Ministers also discussed the situation of New Zealanders living and working in Australia.The Ministers reaffirmed the closeness and importance of the Australia-New Zealand relationship.“Australia is New Zealand’s closest and most important international partner. It’s appropriate that Minister Payne was the first counterpart I have welcomed from overseas since becoming Foreign Minister” said Nanaia Mahuta.“New Zealand also looks forward to welcoming Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for our annual leaders’ talks.”Marise Payne expressed appreciation for New Zealand’s warmth and hospitality. “I look forward to continuing our strong tradition of trans-Tasman partnership, working closely with Minister Mahuta to promote even closer economic ties and personal connections between Australia and New Zealand.”ENDS","Publication Date: 22 April 2021

Innovative te reo prediction tool announced in Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori,"A new Māori language prediction tool will play a key role in tracking our te reo Māori revitalisation efforts, Minister for Māori Development Willie Jackson announced today.He Ara Poutama mō te reo Māori(He Ara Poutama) can forecast the number of conversational and fluent speakers of te reo Māori from now until 2040, using a computer-generated statistical technique.Willie Jackson said being able to see the impact of our language revitalisation efforts and see our progress through a forward-looking lens was a powerful tool.“We all need to do our bit to ensure te reo Māori is a thriving and living language and it’s heartening to see this happening across the motu. He Ara Poutama is clear, what we do now will have implications for years to come,” Willie Jackson said.He Ara Poutama was a Te Whare o te reo Mauriora shared research project that was led by Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori, Te Mātāwai and Ministry of Education.A summary report on the He Ara Poutama tool findings will be published next month.Willie Jackson said the tool was a great example of collaboration across the Māori language sector and would be important for helping research and decision-making within Te Whare o te Reo Mauriora.“For example, He Ara Poutama shows, that for rangatahi, both Māori and non-Māori, having a speaker of te reo Māori in the home is the biggest way to get them more likely to speak conversational te reo Māori.“We must identify more opportunities to grow te reo Māori used in homes and communities. It will be critical to collaborate with Te Mātāwai because it is this entity which is generating critical insights from iwi and whānau Māori.”Willie Jackson said it was important to strengthen the pipeline of Māori language learners and gain traction towards our Māori language goals together in Aotearoa.“Engari ki te kotahi te kākaho ka whati. Ki te kāpuia e kore e whati! If we stick to this and come together it can only be a good thing for us all.“Can I also take this opportunity to encourage everyone to book and get their vaccine against Covid-19.

Free flu vaccines for more New Zealanders,"The Government will fund a quarter of a million more free flu vaccines for this year’s winter campaign to protect our most vulnerable communities and the health system, Health Minister Andrew Little says.“Up to 2-million New Zealanders will be eligible for a free flu vaccination in 2022,” Andrew Little said.“The efforts of the team of 5 million have helped prevent our hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19.“Now, as we prepare to reconnect to the world, we can expect to see more seasonal flu in New Zealand. Vaccinating more people from the flu will save lives, preserve capacity in our hospitals, and is a part of our plan to get through the COVID-19 pandemic,” Andrew Little said.The flu vaccine can be safely administered at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine - whether that be a booster shot or paediatric vaccine.There is no requirement to have a gap between the COVID-19 vaccine and any other vaccine except for the Zostavax shingles vaccine.“It’s so important we continue to do what we can to protect our most vulnerable and this is another way that we can keep New Zealanders safe,” Andrew Little said.Clinical experts at the Ministry of Health and PHARMAC are currently updating the eligibility criteria for a free flu vaccination with a focus on reducing the age of eligibility for at-risk populations, and potentially including a wider range of young people.Currently flu vaccinations are free for pregnant women, over 65s, and people who have certain medical conditions including those with cancer and diabetes.This campaign will run alongside wider paediatric vaccination campaigns to better protect our vulnerable communities from preventable disease.ENDS","Publication Date: 8 February 2022

Mandatory boosters for key workforces progressing well,"More than 5,785 (82%) border workers eligible for a booster vaccination at 6 months have received it so far, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“That’s a really strong uptake considering we announced the requirement the week before Christmas, but we need to continue this momentum,” Chris Hipkins said.“We know that the most likely place for Omicron to enter the community is at the border, so we want all border and eligible health and disability workers to have the extra protection the booster vaccine provides to protect them and their families.  The border continues to be our first line of defence,” Chris Hipkins said.“The Ministry of Health is continuing to work with the sectors that have mandatory workers to help them identify and manage the boosters for their staff. It’s encouraging all employers, covered by the Vaccinations Order or not, to support their employees to get their booster vaccinations as soon as they are able to.“After consultation with the workforces most likely to come into contact with Omicron, workforces covered by the Vaccination Order including border, MIQ and health and disability workers will be required to have their booster by 15 February 2022, or not later than six months after their second dose for those who were only recently vaccinated.“All other workforces covered by the Vaccination Order including Education, Corrections, Police, Defence, and Fire and Emergency workforces will be required to have their booster vaccination by 1 March 2022.“Anyone aged 18 or older who has had two doses of COVID-19 vaccine at least four months ago is able to get their free booster vaccine.  Booster doses are available at all vaccination centres including walk-ins and drive-throughs,” Chris Hipkins said.“The single most important thing New Zealanders can do to prepare for Omicron is to get a booster dose as soon as they are eligible. I want to thank all New Zealanders who have already arranged and received their boosters.”Notes for editors:On 21 December 2021, Cabinet announced a suite of precautionary measures to keep Omicron out of the community for as long as possible, including making it a requirement for eligible border and health workers to get a booster vaccination.International evidence shows that booster doses provide good protection against Omicron, and by achieving high levels of booster protection we will be able to reduce the spread and severity of Omicron when it arrives.Affected workers who are not eligible for a booster vaccination by the set dates should receive a booster vaccination no later than 6 months (183 days) after the completion of their primary course. However, they are eligible for a vaccine booster shot from four months after the completion of their primary vaccine course and the Ministry recommends they take the earlier dose, rather than wait the full six months.People are not eligible for a booster vaccination if they are under 18 years of age. People covered by the Vaccinations Order who are under 18 years, can continue to work and they should not get their booster until they reach 18 years old.The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2022 can be found here:https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0004/latest/","Publication Date: 23 January 2022

Govt tool to support workplace vaccination decision_making launches,"Vaccination assessment tool available today, guiding businesses on vaccine requirements for workersEmployers required to provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinatedMandate for Police and NZDF comes into effect 11:59pm today“Today the Government has launched an assessment tool to help businesses make decisions on vaccine requirements for workers,”Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced.“Vaccinations remain our best tool to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and help keep our workplaces, communities and whānau safe. More than 89 per cent of eligible New Zealanders are now fully vaccinated, which demonstrates the massive effort already undertaken by individuals and workplaces across the country.“Businesses have been calling for clear rules in law to help guide decisions on vaccine requirements for workers. We have delivered on that, with a new, simplified tool to assess when it is reasonable to require vaccination for work, which will be particularly helpful to small businesses.“The assessment tool builds on guidance already provided by WorkSafe. It specifies four key factors, covering public health considerations. At leastthree of the factors must be met before it is reasonable to require vaccination for particular work,” Michael Wood said.The vaccination assessment tool includes the following four factors: the work environment, whether the worker can maintain one metre physical distancing, the length of time the worker is in close proximity to another person, and whether the worker provides services to people who are vulnerable to COVID-19.“I’m aware that many businesses have already conducted their own health and safety risk assessments to determine whether vaccination is required. This new process won’t override those assessments, and businesses can choose which assessment process to follow.“As per normal health and safety processes, any decisions about workplace vaccination requirements must be made in consultation with workers and their representatives, like unions.“The clarity and detail in the tool provides confidence to businesses and workers that the right process is being followed,” Michael Wood said.","Publication Date: 15 December 2021

Rollout to start from 17 January prior to school returning in 2022.Cabinet confirms use of traffic light system to manage outbreak and in the event of Omicron outbreaks areas will move into the red traffic light settingCabinet has agreed a suite of precautionary measures to keep Omicron out of the community for as long as possible, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“All of the evidence so far points to Omicron being the most transmissible COVID-19 variant yet and public health advice says that soon, every case that comes into MIQ will be Omicron,” Chris Hipkins said.“But experts still don’t know how severe it is. So while it’s sweeping the globe at a bewildering speed and appears to be the dominant variant, how sick it makes people and the impact it has on health systems is not yet fully understood.“With over 70 countries around the world reporting Omicron cases and its high  transmissibility, our plan is to get as prepared as we can by speeding up boosters and strengthening our border to keep Omicron out of the community for as long as possible.“We start our response to Omicron with a number of advantages on our side. We have over 90 per cent and rising of the population fully vaccinated, we still have our border protections and MIQ in place, school has finished for the year and we are heading into summer when we are outdoors more.“But we need to do more. Parts of the world are going back into lockdown and experiencing major disruption, and with these extra steps we aim to keep Omicron at bay to ensure New Zealanders get the break they deserve and businesses can remain open.Boosters“The first step in our plan is accelerating the booster rollout, following advice from the Director-General.“The advice from the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group is that shortening the period between the second and booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine is an appropriate and pragmatic step and is in line with what other countries are doing.“Data is emerging that a booster dose with Pfizer provides better protection than two-dose course against the Omicron variant.“While two doses is likely to hold a good degree of protection against severe disease from Omicron, a third dose is likely to offer great protection against transmission of COVID-19 and reducing the chance of more serious infections.“The shorter timeframe will start in January and we’ll continue to follow health advice if it recommends the gap in doses can and should reduce further.“Over 82 per cent of vaccinated New Zealanders will be eligible for a booster by the end of February 2022.“We know that the most likely place for Omicron to enter the community is at the border, so we want all border and eligible health workers to have the extra protection the booster vaccine provides to protect them and their families.The border continues to be our first line of defence.“More than half of border workers eligible for a booster at 6 months have already had it – which is a great response – but we need to get the numbers up quickly.“Cabinet has therefore agreed in principle that where workers are required to be vaccinated, that this mandate will also extend to boosters.“Initially this will be for those workers most likely to come into contact with Omicron -- border and health workers -- who will be required to have their booster by the end of January, or not later six months after their second dose for those who were only recently vaccinated, and then to all others who are under a vaccination mandate by the 1st of March.Strengthening MIQ“We are fortunate we still have MIQ in place. Without it, Omicron would already be in the community and Christmas plans would be under threat.“To further strengthen the border, we’re shortening the pre-departure test requirement from 72 hours to 48 hours before travel in order to assist in picking up more people with the virus before they get on a plane.“And we’ve sought advice on implementing a requirement for all non-New Zealand citizens entering to New Zealand to have had a booster dose before flying.“We are also making a temporary change to MIQ that increases the length of stay from 7 to 10 days. Currently returnees do their final 3 days of isolation at home. Bringing those final three days back into MIQ reduces the risk of the virus entering the community.Changes to re-opening plan“To slow the rapid spread we have seen overseas, we are pushing out the start of non-MIQ travel until the end of February 2022.“There’s no doubt this is disappointing and will upset many holiday plans, but it’s important to set these changes out clearly today so they can have time to consider those plans.“COVID-19 keeps throwing new curve balls and we have to respond in a way that continues to protect lives and livelihoods without putting in place restrictions and lockdowns unless absolutely necessary.“Waiting till the end of February will increase New Zealand’s overall protection and slow Omicron’s eventual spread.Use of traffic light system to manage outbreaks“With these changes, we’re buying New Zealand as much time as we can, as scientists here and overseas race to get a clearer picture of Omicron.“In moving to the traffic light system, we signalled that we would be adjusting to more of a reactive stance when it came to protective measures and would apply them when case numbers grew and the health system came under pressure.“Omicron has changed that. When it does arrive, we expect that it will spread fast, and that’s what we’re seeing in other places. To slow that spread, we may use the red traffic light settings earlier on. That will give us the best chance to avoid returning to more restrictive alert level settings.“It is not our intention to move to lockdowns unless absolutely necessary in the event of a widespread outbreak where our health system comes under considerable strain – and even then the strong preference is for the lockdown to be highly targeted.Chris Hipkins said faced with alternative courses of action, and looking at overseas jurisdictions, Cabinet is strongly of the view that this plan is the best approach for New Zealand.“By the end of February when we revisit the phased border re-opening, around 3 million more Kiwis will be eligible for the booster shots and the rollout to 5-11 year-olds will be well underway.” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 21 December 2021

Further COVID_19 vaccine and economic support for the Pacific,"New Zealand will be providing protection against COVID-19 to at least 1.2 million people in the Pacific over the coming year$120 million in Official Development Assistance has been reprioritised to support Pacific economies in 2021Foreign Affairs Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta and Associate Health and Foreign Affairs Minister Aupito William Sio announced today that New Zealand will provide COVID-19 vaccines for rollout in the Cook Islands beginning on 19 May, followed by Niue and Tokelau.“This continues our ongoing commitment to support our Pacific neighbours through the increased challenges the COVID-19 pandemic is placing upon our region,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“By working closely with our Pacific neighbours, and other partners, we can provide a further line of defence for our entire region – better protecting us all against the impact of the pandemic which continues to rage across the world,” said Nanaia Mahuta.“New Zealand is working with the Realm countries to ensure that everything is in place for the countries to receive and administer safe and effective vaccines at the earliest possible time. This work begins with the Cook Islands’ May rollout, which is expected to take 12 weeks to complete, with Niue and Tokelau to follow. ” Aupito William Siosaid.The delivery of vaccines to the Realm countries won’t impact the planned New Zealand domestic rollout.Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu have started their vaccine rollouts with doses received from the global COVAX Facility. Each will also be able to receive enough additional doses from New Zealand’s own portfolio to fully cover their population, as well as any further support they might need for their vaccine rollout. In addition, Fiji has taken up the offer of AstraZeneca doses for 250,000 people donated by New Zealand, subject to Medsafe approval.“New Zealand is following up its commitment to equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines by donating enough for 800,000 people through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. These doses will go to developing countries, with a focus on the Pacific.“In total, this means New Zealand will be providing protection against COVID-19 to at least 1.2 million people in the Pacific over the coming year,” said Aupito William Sio.New Zealand is also partnering with Australia and UNICEF to procure further vaccines for the Pacific and providing other targeted support where necessary.“To support Papua New Guinea with its COVID-19 outbreak, New Zealand is providing $4 million to help fund its vaccine rollout, medical equipment for a COVID-19 field hospital in Port Moresby and logistical air support to get health staff, PPE and vaccines to remote areas of PNG,” Nanaia Mahuta said.Nanaia Mahuta also announced New Zealand is providing further support to assist economic recovery in the Pacific.“New Zealand’s further economic support to Pacific countries will help them respond to the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and move towards long-term economic resilience, the Ministers said. To this end, $120 million in Official Development Assistance has been reprioritised to support Pacific economies in 2021.“The economic disruption affecting many countries in the Pacific, particularly those that have tourism-focused economies, is unprecedented. This funding will be used by our Pacific neighbours to help households get through this crisis, and support businesses to manage the uncertainty of closed borders,” said Nanaia Mahuta.ENDS","Publication Date: 13 May 2021

Big jump in New Zealanders who say they_ll get vaccinated,"Latest research shows more New Zealanders in major demographic groups will get a COVID-19 vaccine, as the number of doses administered reaches half a million, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“Ministry of Health research from April shows 77 per cent of New Zealanders aged 16 years and over say they are likely to get a vaccine or have already received a vaccine. This compares to 69 per cent in March,” Chris Hipkins said.“The results show thenumber of people who say they are unlikely to get vaccinated dropped to 12 per cent, down from 20 per cent in March and 24 percent in December 2020. Of the 12 per cent unlikely, there remains a smaller group of people who are opposed, at 7.8 per cent.”Latest acceptance rates:Overall – 77 per cent, up from 69 per cent, or 3,147,200 out of 4,082,500 New Zealanders 16 and over7 per cent of these people have had one or two dosesMaori – 71 per cent, up from 64 percent in MarchPasifika – 79 per cent, up from 59 percent in MarchOver 65s are the most likely to get vaccinated“This is really encouraging. Major information campaigns, solid progress in the vaccine rollout and strong role models in each community are making a real difference.“Given the rollout has been underway for three months, it is fantastic to already see a steady decline in those who say they won’t get a vaccine, including in those communities considered high-risk.“We do know it’s important to understand why people might not be ready to commit to getting the vaccine just yet.“This research indicates that 15 per cent are still unsure whether they have to pay for the vaccine, which is why we keep repeating that it’s free.“Those who identify as disabled are more likely on average to be unsure whether they’ll get vaccinated and there remains a number of people who want to know more about the safety of the vaccine, so we’ve still got work to do.“But it’s pleasing that the number of people with concerns about the vaccine approval process has nearly halved to 36 per cent, down from 60 per cent in December.“New Zealand’s medicine approval regime for COVID-19 vaccines is one of the most rigorous in the world. This improvement shows that while mis- and dis-information campaigns remain a concern for the Government, people are getting access to good and accurate information.”More than half a million doses administered“The vaccination programme is further ahead than where it was projected to be at this stage,” Chris Hipkins said.“As of last night, 505,820 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered, three months after the first person was vaccinated. This is a significant milestone.“It took 49 days to reach 100,000 doses, two weeks to reach 200,000, 12 days to get to 300,000, eight days to hit 400,000 and another eight days to reach the half million.“Given the complexity and sheer scale of the task at hand this is a strong confidence booster in the vaccination programme as we prepare for the bulk of the vaccine to arrive in country from July.“We know our supply of vaccines will be constrained to the end of June, but our planning has always been predicated on larger amounts of vaccine arriving from July, enabling us to finish vaccinating Group 3 and then move into the wider population.“The vast majority of DHBs have already started vaccinating Group 3 or will do so in the next few weeks, and we remain on track to make the vaccine available to everyone in New Zealand by the end of 2021,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 21 May 2021

Government invests in the wellbeing of whānau Māori,"$380 million delivering about 1,000 new homes for Māori including papakāinga housing, repairs to about 700 Māori-owned homes and expanding support services.$242.8 million for Māori health initiatives, including setting up the new Māori Health Authority.$150 million in Māori Education to support Māori boarding schools and lift kōhanga reo teachers’ pay.$42 million to build a sustainable Māori media sector and invest in programme content.$15 million for Māori tourism.$14.8 million for the implementation of the Māori language strategy.Investing in the wellbeing of Māori will drive both our economic and social recovery from the effects of COVID-19.This year’s Māori Budget package invests in the right areas to help our economic recovery plan while ensuring we deliver on the promises we made to Māori in areas like housing, health, education, tamariki, whānau, justice reform and te reo me ōna tikanga Māori. The total Māori Budget package is in excess of $1 billion.The Government’s Māori Ministers; Kelvin Davis, Nanaia Mahuta, Peeni Henare, Willie Jackson and Meka Whaitiri have announced a historic investment moment for Māori.The social and economic effects of COVID-19 were still being felt by many whānau across Aotearoa,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“Māori Ministers have worked hard to respond to some of the most pressing issues our whānau are facing while ensuring that our social investment will bring with it economic growth in regions with the greatest need.“This Budget package builds on the previous investment we have made in economic initiatives like He Poutama Rangatahi, Mana in Mahi, Māori Cadetships and Māori apprenticeships, as well as advances we have made in Justice Reform, in the education sector and in protecting te reo Māori,” Associate Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta said.“Building houses and upgrading kura not only provides whānau with homes and better education, it creates jobs and stimulates our local economy.“Investing in Māori tourism helps bring back jobs and supports our small businesses to ready themselves to reconnect with the world.“And our investment in Health, alongside our Vaccine Strategy, means when we do reconnect – we do so while keeping our people safe,” Nanaia Mahuta said.Health and HousingAssociate Māori Housing and Māori Health Minister Peeni Henare said improving Māori health and ensuring Māori had access to warm dry homes, were the core reasons behind the $242.8 million investment into Māori health and $380 million targeted towards a Māori Housing package.The funding for Māori health includes $98.1 million for the establishment of the Māori Health Authority, $17.8 million to support ofiwi/Māori partnership boards and $126.8 million for Hauora Māori programmes run by the Māori Health Authority including funding for increasing provider capability and a Māori health innovation fund.Budget 2021 will invest $380 million into Māori housing across Aotearoa, the funding will deliver approximately:1,000 additional new houses that will be a range of papakāinga housing, affordable rentals, transitional housing, and owner-occupied housingrepairs for 700 Māori-owned houses improving the quality of homes for whānau in most need, led by Te Puni Kōkiri$30 million towards building future capability for iwi and Māori groups to accelerate housing projects and a range of support services.We have also ensured that $350 million of the Housing Acceleration Fund will be targeted to investment in infrastructure to support Māori and iwi providers build homes for whānau Māori.“Health and Housing have always been our top priority and these funds will help get better health outcomes for our people and enable us to partner with Māori from across the regions to build a suite of housing solutions for Māori on the ground.”The investment in Housing will also create jobs and employment opportunities for many areas that need them in the wake of COVID-19.“The funding injection will support the new and independent Māori Health Authority and the iwi/Māori partnership boards, with a significant portion allocated to Hauora Māori Health programmes run by the Māori Health Authority including funding for increasing provider capability and a Māori health innovation fund,” Peeni Henare said.Māori TourismMinister for Māori Development Willie Jackson said Māori tourism faced significant challenges as a result of COVID-19.Last year, the Government invested $12 million in NZ Māori Tourism, which helped support Māori businesses to pivot, transition or hibernate in response to COVID-19.Budget 2021 will support three separate kaupapa – the expansion of the business support services already offered by New Zealand Māori Tourism, work to position the Māori Tourism Industry for the future, as well as providing funding for anchor projects like the East Coast cycle track.“Now we are working towards reconnecting with the world, we are helping to kick start our Māori tourism sector by investing $15 million, as a charge against the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, in their restart to enable them to play a strong role in our economic recovery,” Willie Jackson said.Tamariki and WhānauMinister for Children Kelvin Davis announced that Budget 2021 has set aside $23.4 million in the wellbeing of tamariki and whānau in the greatest need.Oranga Tamariki will be working with partners in 2021 to develop a strategy for the children’s system that responds to the findings of the recent reviews, as well as upcoming reports from the Waitangi Tribunal and the Ministerial Advisory Board.The Strategy is likely to envisage a system where tamariki with the greatest need are safe and supported within their whānau by marae, hapū, iwi and their communities at the earliest opportunity, enabled by a system that’s trusted to step in only when needed.Budget 2021 funding will help ensure we develop solutions that take a by Māori, for Māori approach to improve the support that Māori can deliver to tamariki and whānau in need.“We have a lot of work still to do with Oranga Tamariki but this targeted funding will help move the organisation in the right direction by enabling us to devolve more power to the regions and to Māori, and ensuring tamariki stay with their whānau where possible,” Kelvin Davis said.Justice ReformMāori pathways for wāhine in Christchurch women’s prison was just one of a number of justice reform initiatives the five Ministers were announcing in Budget 2021, Kelvin Davis said.“We are investing more than $10 million into this new co-designed pathway ensuring wāhine are provided a Māori pathway out of prison. A journey they can share with their whānau.“Across the system, we are investing in Māori solutions. $70 million is to be invested in Te Pae Oranga iwi community panels – a tikanga Māori and whānau ora based alternative to court for low-level offending.“We are investing $12 million to prevent family violence and sexual violence by expanding whānau-centred facilitation by kaupapa Māori providers, $13.7 million in Whakaorangia te mana tangata – which aims to uplift the mana of offenders, victims and their whānau,” Kelvin Davis said.Māori EducationOver $150 million will be invested in Māori education through this year’s Budget.This includes a $20 million package to support Māori boarding schools, an investment in our future, Meka Whaitiri said.“Our Māori boarding schools grow the next generation of Māori leaders, and it is important that we preserve the vital role they play in the education of our rangatahi.”As well as Māori boarding schools, Budget 2021 addresses immediate cost pressures facing wānanga with $32.3 million and also sets aside funds to start to address the inequitable funding of wānanga.For tamariki and mokopuna funding has also been set aside to improve pay in our kōhanga reo.We are also investing $77 million in property funding to build and expand schools delivering Māori medium education and investing in Māori learners’ success by putting more funding into Te Reo Matatini, Pāngarau, and Marautanga.“Māori education has seen a significant investment boost under this Government, Budget 2021 is a further investment in the education of our tamariki and rangatahi,” Meka Whaitiri said.Māori Data Sovereignty“A lesson we learnt from our experience with COVID-19 is the need for better data collection, and the necessity for us to partner with Māori to gather this information that will provide better guidance to iwi and to the Government when making policy decisions in areas that affect our people,” Associate Minister of Statistics Meka Whaitiri said.“We have secured through Budget 2021, $14.1 million to support our Treaty partners in building their data collection and analysis capability by assisting iwi to collect responses to the 2023 Census in two geographic areas. This initiative also aims to support the existing 2023 Census programme by improving response rates in priority groups.”Te Reo me ōna tikanga“Safeguarding te reo Māori for future generations is a goal this Government is taking seriously, and Budget 2021 enables us to take the next step in achieving these aspirations,” Willie Jackson said.“An investment of $14.8 million is going to further support the implementation of the Māori language strategy, helping us to achieve our goal of one million New Zealanders able to speak basic te reo Māori by 2040.“More equitable funding for Māori is vital and investing $42 million into Māori broadcasting to build a sustainable Māori media sector and investing in programme content, is a step in the right direction.“We all want to mihi to our fellow Māori Minister Kiri Allan. Before she took leave she secured $45.7 million operating and $850,000 capital funding for emergency management. An immediate priority will be growing the role iwi Māori play.“We are all very proud of the Māori Budget package for 2021. It strikes the right balance between economic recovery and social investment, all while ensuring we take a ‘by Māori, for Māori’ approach in areas like justice reform, health and education.“We are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19, and we have still more to do. Budget 2021 shows we are tackling the hard problems while putting the wellbeing of whānau at the centre of our solutions,” Willie Jackson said.","Publication Date: 20 May 2021

More vaccinators coming on board for COVID_19 campaign,"Retired and overseas-trained health professionals and the wider health workforce can now join New Zealand’s expanding vaccinator workforce, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.The Government has changed Medicines Regulations to allow more health workers to be trained to give vaccinations – to lend a hand as we move to the next phase of the biggest vaccination campaign in New Zealand’s history.“We’re calling on retired nurses, people who have trained overseas but are not registered here, and those in the kaiāwhina workforce – who work in our health system already in roles such as healthcare assistants – to join our vaccinator team,” Chris Hipkins said.“More than 12,500 people with a wide range of backgrounds, including many ex health professionals, have already logged their details in the Hands-Up database, which is designed to capture a broad range of skills and backgrounds for different roles.“We anticipate many of the former health professionals who have entered their details into Hands-Up will be keen to become involved in the vaccination programme.“DHBs have been following up with potential candidates to bring people on board as we scale up the vaccination programme.“Others urged to join in can enrol through the databasewww.health.govt.nz/HandsUpRegistrations can be completed in English, Te Reo Māori, Samoan and Tongan.“The change will also allow us to boost the numbers of Māori and Pacific vaccinators.It also provides these new vaccinators with enhanced career opportunities in the health sector.“The Immunisation Advisory Centre has trained more than 8,100 COVID-19 vaccinators from across the health sector since the beginning of the year,” Chris Hipkins said.“This influx of health workers will boost both these numbers and the diversity of the workforce.“All new recruits will receive training through the Immunisation Advisory Centre and will work under the supervision and direction of registered health practitioners.“They will also be trained in basic emergency techniques, including resuscitation and treatment of anaphylaxis. This is required for anyone administering medicines across the health workforce.“Current projections are that we will need 1,600 full-time equivalent vaccinators at the peak of the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. This means we will likely need between 6,000 to 6,500 people vaccinating in part or full time roles,” Chris Hipkins said.Gisborne iwi health provider first to complete vaccinator training“I’d like to congratulate 12 kaiāwhina from Tūranga Health, an Iwi health provider in Gisborne, who have become the first to complete the face-to-face training to become COVID-19 vaccinators from this new workforce.“This group of vaccinators are from a broad range of roles and backgrounds and are excited to learn new skills to support the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in protecting whānau in Tūranga-nui-a-Kiwa and surrounding areas. They are a welcome addition to Tūranga Health’s 14 vaccinators.”Profiles of two new vaccinators:Henry Lamont, who has worked as a whānau ora kaiāwhina at Tūranga Health for the past two and a half years, said it was a “no-brainer” to take up the opportunity to train as a COVID-19 vaccinator.“It means I can help to help protect whānau in my community. And me being a male Māori, it gives that option for whānau to choose when they get vaccinated.”As coach for the local junior rep team in touch rugby and well-known in sporting circles, he hoped to leverage off his community links to encourage people to get vaccinated.Dallas Poi, an experienced kaiāwhina and community manager for Tūranga Health, said she was excited to get the opportunity to contribute to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in her community.“My whakapapa is to Rongowhakaata and Ngāti Porou so I’ll be a familiar face as a vaccinator for whānau. The training raises the competency level of kaiāwhina and extends our scope of practice, which is also important in our role to promote health.“We’re looking forward to giving actual injections to whānau and we’re really stoked to be the first to complete the face-to-face part of the training.”","Publication Date: 2 July 2021

Further COVID_19 economic support for Cook Islands and Fiji announced,"Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced a further package of support for the Cook Islands and Fiji for COVID-19 economic support and recovery.“Aotearoa New Zealand remains committed to supporting our Pacific fanau and vuvale to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on their economies, and move towards long-term economic resilience,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“As the duration of the pandemic lengthens, so do the economic challenges affecting many countries in the Pacific, particularly those that have tourism-focused economies such as the Cook Islands and Fiji.“While vaccination uptake has been excellent in these countries, rebuilding tourism will take time. This funding will help their Governments to continue supporting the needs of their most vulnerable communities.“It will also contribute to sustaining livelihoods through measures such as social support payments, infrastructure stimulus, and tourism business support,” Nanaia Mahuta said.This economic package of $100 million brings COVID-19 budget support provided to the Cook Islands and Fiji during the global pandemic to a combined total of $215 million.In addition to health and vaccine support, New Zealand is also supporting other initiatives that contribute to economic resilience. These include improved access to advice and finance for small-medium businesses in the Cook Islands and supporting Fiji to implement reforms to improve the business and investment climate.“We know that we all need to play our part in the global effort to respond and recover from COVID-19, especially with our close Pacific neighbours. By working together we are ensuring a stronger, more resilient region that sees benefits for everyone,” Nanaia Mahuta said.New Zealand is providing $60 million to the Cook Islands, and $40 million to Fiji.","Publication Date: 28 November 2021

Limited change to onsite learning _ for senior secondary students _ in Level 3 regions,"Onsite learning at schools in Level 3 regions will start from next week for senior secondary school students to prepare for end of year exams, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“Secondary schools in these regions will start onsite learning for years 11 to 13 on Tuesday 26 October,” Chris Hipkins said.“This is a complex issue requiring difficult trade-offs between improving education and increasing potential health risks for children and young people.“Learners in this age group are able to be vaccinated and are required to wear masks, and staff and volunteers working on site will need a negative test before attending.“Government agencies have also continued to refine public health measures for school and early learning services.“Children, young people and staff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should stay at home unless fully vaccinated, face coverings are mandatory for staff and learners in years 9 to 13, and records must be kept for contact tracing purposes. Face coverings on school transport will also be mandatory.“And staff and volunteers in all regions need to receive their first vaccine by 15 November.“For years 1 to 10 the picture is more complex. I’m not completely ruling out these students in level 3 regions being able to return before the end of the year but if they do, we’ll need to be satisfied there are sufficient processes in place to minimise any risk.“We’ve got to acknowledge that any settings where there are groups of children under 12, it’s higher risk – as they are not yet able to be vaccinated.“But there are mitigations that can be put in place to keep the risk as low as possible. We can consider rostered attendance to reduce the number of students on site at any given time. The warmer summer months also provide more opportunities for learning outdoors where the risk of COVID-19 spreading is lower.“Cabinet will consider the latest health advice and the options on Tuesday.”Notes to editorsThere will no longer be bubbles of up to 10 students required when all senior students return on-site, including for those students already on-site in years 1 - 10.Wherever practicable a 1 metre distance should be kept from all others on-site, particularly between staff, and a two metre distance from people you don’t know.Requirements for secondary schools:staff and children who are unwell must stay at home, and get tested for COVID-19children at higher risk of severe illness remain home, where possiblestaff who are not fully vaccinated and at higher risk of severe illness must remain homemandatory mask wearing for staff and students in years 9 - 13only essential visitors will be permitted onsite, and all visitors on-site will need to wear a face coveringgood hand hygiene and cough and sneeze etiquetteclassrooms to be well ventilatedhigh touch surfaces will be cleaned and disinfected each dayphysical distancing will be adhered to wherever practicable, particularly between adultsphysical distancing of two metres will be in place from people you don’t knowQR code posters for the COVID app will be displayeda contact tracing register in place for everyone coming onsite including students and staff, through the attendance register, timetable and visitor register.face coverings will be required on school transport for people aged 12 and overtime outdoors for students and staff will be maximised, including breaks, lunchtime, before and after school (unless the weather does not allow), and rooms will be aired during breaksexercising and singing will take place outdoorsgroups meeting indoors, including assemblies or staff meetings, will be avoided.","Publication Date: 20 October 2021

Therapeutic Products Bill introduced,"Legislation to modernise the way medicines, medical devices and natural health products are regulated has been introduced in Parliament today.The Therapeutic Products Bill replaces the Medicines Act 1981 and Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985 with a comprehensive regulatory regime that is fit for the future.Health Minister Andrew Little said the Bill will give New Zealanders peace-of-mind about the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicines, medical devices (such as COVID-19 test kits) and natural health products they are using.“Quality medicines and medical devices are essential for a well-functioning health system, and consumers need to know the natural health products they’re buying off the shelf are safe,” Andrew Little said.“The Therapeutic Products Bill is a flexible regulatory framework for how therapeutic products are manufactured, prescribed, imported, advertised, supplied and exported, and makes the regulation of clinical trials more robust.“It enables New Zealand to take advantage of advances in medicine, such as cell and tissue therapies, emerging gene therapies, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning software. Having risk-proportionate approval systems will improve access to necessary and life-saving medicines, such as vaccines in a pandemic.“Consumer safety sits at the heart of the Bill, so the community will be better protected from goods and gadgets that make unfounded or misleading therapeutic claims.“Having a modern set of laws and regulations that line up with international practices will also help our medicines and natural health products industries to export to the world.“The Therapeutic Products Bill has been more than a decade in the making and, alongside the Pae Ora (Health Futures) Act, will contribute to building a health system New Zealanders expect and deserve,” Andrew Little said.ADDITIONAL NOTESDetailed considerationThe Therapeutic Products Bill is the result of more than a decade of policy work. It incorporates what has been learned from consultation on the Natural Health and Supplementary Products Bill that was introduced in 2011 before being discontinued, as well as the regulation of therapeutic products policy proposals released in April 2016.The Bill is expected to have its first reading in Parliament before Christmas and will be referred to the Health Select Committee for detailed examination including public and industry submissions.Natural health productsThe Therapeutic Products Bill will regulate natural health products, but in a separate category from medicines and medical devices.Natural health products are intended to support, promote or maintain health in some way, so are in the category of ‘therapeutic products’.However the rules applying to natural health products will reflect the fact that they are generally lower risk than medicines and medical devices.The Bill will ensure market standards for the quality of products (such as Vitamin C tablets) in the places they are already supplied, such as supermarkets.New regulatorThe Bill establishes a new regulator within Manatū Hauora – Ministry of Health, headed by an independent statutory officer, with a wider remit than the medicines regulator Medsafe.The new regulator will be responsible for ensuring the safety, quality and efficacy of regulated products across their lifecycle. It will design and implement proportionate, risk-based market authorisation pathways to support the timely availability of therapeutic products. Its functions will include, in addition to market authorisation, licensing controlled activities, post-market surveillance, compliance and enforcement.Additional resources will be made available to setup the new regulatory regime while ensuring the day-to-day work of Medsafe continues efficiently. The new regulator have the same ability as Medsafe to recover costs through fees, charges and levies, which will be set after consultation with the relevant sectors, professions and individuals it regulates.The Bill also includes a range of modern enforcement tools allowing for a graduated and proportionate response to breaches, including tiered criminal offences, strict liability offences, improved infringement notices and a civil pecuniary penalty regime.","Publication Date: 30 November 2022

New booster plan in time for winter,"All New Zealanders aged 30 and over will be able to access the new COVID bivalent booster from April as part of the Government’s plan to keep Kiwis safe and take pressure off our health system, says Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall.The new bivalent vaccine will replace the existing Pfizer booster and is consideredlikely to be moreeffective against Omicron subvariants. Bivalent vaccines work by combiningtwo strains of a virus, which prompts the body to create antibodies against both strains, providing a greater level of protection.“From 1 April, anyone 30+ will be eligible to receive the bivalent vaccine, as long as it’s been at least 6 months since their last COVID-19 booster or positive COVID-19 test,” Dr Verrall said.“People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 will also be able to receive an additional booster, regardless of how many doses they’ve previously had.“As well as broadening the criteria from April, from 1 March anyone currently eligible for a COVID-19 booster will be able to get the new bivalent vaccine.“We know vaccination is the best protection against the virus, and these actions will provide added protection to a larger number of adult New Zealanders. Latest reporting from the Ministry of Health indicated 8,220 cases over the previous week so the virus is definitely still circulating out there.“We’re also planning for older New Zealanders and those most at risk of getting sick to get a flu jab at the same time as their COVID-19 booster. This will be part of a ‘one and done’ approach to help people stay well this winter.“Because it may be a while since your previous boosters, now is a good time to check your records onwww.BookMyVaccine.nz. Vaccination against COVID-19 remains free.“Getting boosted is important for your health and keeping out of hospital this winter,” Ayesha Verrall said.ENDSEditors NotesIn making this decision, the Government accepted advice from the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group (CV-TAG) and other experts.Those currently eligible for the COVID-19 booster are encouraged to make a booking by visitingwww.BookMyVaccine.nzor calling the COVID-19 Vaccination Healthline on 0800 28 29 26 (8am to 8pm, 7 days a week).People who will become eligible for an additional booster from 1 April will be able to make a booking later in March.ELIGIBILITY CRITERIACurrent eligibilityFirst boostersIf you're aged 18 or over, and you completed your primary vaccination course* at least 3 months ago, you're eligible for a Pfizer booster.

COVID_19 vaccine slated for possible approval next week,"The green light for New Zealand’s first COVID-19 vaccine could be granted in just over a week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today.“We’re making swift progress towards vaccinating New Zealanders against the virus, but we’re also absolutely committed to ensuring the vaccines are safe and effective,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Medicines regulator Medsafe will seek advice and recommendations from the Medicines Assessment Advisory Committee (MAAC) next Tuesday, about the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.“The Ministerial expert advisory committee will review Medsafe’s benefit-risk assessment of the pharmaceutical company’s data and, depending on feedback, Medsafe may be able to grant provisional approval as soon as the following day.“Medsafe’s process not only ensures New Zealanders can feel confident in the vaccines we receive, it’s also been timely and means we will be ready to receive and administer vaccines as soon as Pfizer is in a position to send them.“We’ve always known a safe and effective vaccine is a vital part of our COVID-19 response for our long-term control of the virus. 2021 is Year of the Vaccine,” Jacinda Ardern said.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said COVID-19 vaccines will play a critical role in protecting New Zealanders’ health and wellbeing and, over time, will be a big step back to normality.“Our first focus will be vaccinating our border and managed isolation and quarantine workforce and their close contacts. Once the vaccine arrives in New Zealand, we expect to be able to complete vaccinating this group within two to three weeks.“These brave people have been protecting our country from this global pandemic during the past year and protecting them and those who share their households is a priority for us.“That will be the start of New Zealand’s largest ever vaccination campaign. And that will take some time and the most important thing is when we finish not when we start.  However we do intend to get our front line staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Doing so will add another layer to our border defences. We hope to start vaccinating the wider population mid-year.“If granted, the provisional approval will mean that Medsafe has sufficient information and assurance of both safety and effectiveness for it to allow vaccination to start – though there will be continued monitoring of the vaccine here and overseas.“However, if Medsafe decides next week that some additional assurances are required before it grants approval, I accept their decision and am satisfied that it’s the right decision on behalf of all of us.“It’s vital for New Zealanders to know that Medsafe is undertaking robust assessments of this vaccine and others so that we can be confident they’re safe and effective. It streamlined its approval processes for faster access, but it hasn’t cut any corners along the way.“Safety is paramount and we want to be assured of this and also allow all New Zealanders the same opportunity of protection as other countries,” Chris Hipkins said.Q and AHow long will theMedicines Assessment Advisory Committeetake to make their recommendations?We expect they will make their recommendations and give their advice to Medsafe, which has delegated authority from the Minister, on 2 February.Who is on theMedicines Assessment Advisory Committee?It is an 11-member committee of people from around New Zealand with a broad range of skills, such as biostatistics, infectious diseases, geriatrics, paediatrics, consumer interests, pharmaceutical chemistry and manufacturing, clinical pharmacology, toxicology, clinical genetics, rheumatology and psychiatry. Their identities aren’t public to protect them from external pressure in giving independent, free and frank advice about medicine approvals.Where will the 2 February meeting take place?The members are from around New Zealand so will meet virtually, as is usual practice. Key Medsafe members will also attend.What happens next after MAAC gives their recommendations and advice on 2 February?Medsafe will consider its feedback and may decide to grant provisional consent, which will likely include conditions that require the pharmaceutical company to provide data and information within an agreed timeframe. This includes additional clinical trial and manufacturing data as it becomes available. If the company agrees to any required conditions, Medsafe will formally gazette the decision to approve the vaccine’s provisional consent for use in New Zealand. That could happen as quickly as the day after the MAAC meeting.When will the vaccines arrive in New Zealand?We expect the first vaccines will arrive in New Zealand by the end of the first quarter but we are making sure everything is in place in case of an earlier arrival. We have broadly similar timing expectations as Australia. We acknowledge that there is international pressures for Pfizer and BioNTech to prioritise countries that have serious community transmission of COVID-19. As we have seen, timelines are changing often.How has Medsafe streamlined its approval process?We have prioritised the COVID-19 vaccines and allocated assessors for each vaccine candidate. We have close communication with the pharmaceutical companies about the timelines for getting their data and we’ve been accepting rolling submissions of data.We received the first set of data from Pfizer last November. Last week, we received a large amount of data from Pfizer. After assessing it, we’ve asked them some questions, for which we’ve requested a response in a week. Normally we’d give companies four months to respond.What happens if we choose not to use but Australia does?New Zealand, like Australia, has to make a decision to use that will best support our Immunisation Programme from the portfolio of vaccines that have been purchased.Why are you vaccinating border workers first?We’ve always known that our greatest risk of COVID-19 entering New Zealand is at our border because the virus is rampant in many countries overseas, which is why we’ve put such tight measures in place at our border.Protecting people working at the border and those at greatest risk of COVID-19 protects our entire population.Our sequencing of who we vaccinate first only changes if our situation changes, such as if we have widespread community transmission.How will we safeguard Māori?Under the no/low transmission scenario, the best protection for everyone in New Zealand is to protect those who are most at risk of infection and their household contacts.We are also reviewing the evidence for additional risk faced by Māori and Pacific peoples in relation to infection and transmission, more serious illness and death, and the cultural, social and economic impacts.We will engage with key stakeholders and consider this alongside implementation options to determine the best approach.Where will the first vaccinations of the general public be done?Initial delivery settings are likely to be workplace and some community locations. We are engaging with DHBs on their local plans for the initial scenarios, including the providers they are likely to engage. As more vaccines become available, we will add new settings as we scale through the year.How much will all the doses of vaccinations cost?Cabinet has set aside just under $NZ 1 billion ($NZ 983.7 million) from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to secure access to COVID-19 vaccines.This will be New Zealand’s largest immunisation roll out ever. We have never before attempted an immunisation programme of this scale, cost or complexity.We’re aiming to vaccinate as many New Zealanders as possible – so that’s potentially 5 million people.Do you have enough vaccinators trained for the rollout?We’re planning for an extra 2,000-3,000 full time (or equivalent) vaccinators who will be trained and available when needed throughout New Zealand.An initial call for expressions of interest has gone out via the COVID-19 surge workforce webpage, and we are working with partners across the health and disability system (including regulatory authorities for the relevant healthcare professions and occupational health providers) to engage additional vaccinator capacity across New Zealand.So far more than 1,100 people have registered their interest in being involved. In addition, more than 1,200 people have been trained as provisional vaccinators, ready to complete the COVID-19 vaccine training once available.The Ministry of Health has contracted the Immunisation Advisory Centre to provide training on COVID-19 vaccines. This training is expected to begin in February — initially for those vaccinators who will deliver the Pfizer vaccine and then for nurses, doctors and pharmacists. This training will be available online and face to face across the country.","Publication Date: 26 January 2021

COVID_19 vaccinator workforce tracking well for peak of rollout,"New Zealand’s COVID-19 vaccinator workforce continues to expand with more than 10,000 people having now completed Pfizer vaccine training, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“It’s fantastic news that 10,497 vaccinators have now worked through the vaccinator training course,” Chris Hipkins said.“With 5114 of those people having been active in the vaccinator workforce since February, the increasing size and scope of the rollout is clearly benefitting from their expertise.“A huge amount of work has gone on to have the vaccinator workforce ready to peak at the right time - the Ministry of Health predicts we’ll need at least 1,600 full-time equivalent vaccinators during the periods of highest demand in September and October.“However, because of the part-time nature of many roles, during this key period we’ll actually need more than 6,500 people active on the vaccine roster at any one time.“Today’s tally means we’re on track to meet that goal.“We’ve also been seeing a strong response to our programme targeting kaiāwhinavaccinators – people already working in our health system in roles such as healthcare assistants. When trained, thekaiāwhina workstreamfeeds into the broader group.“More than 250 people have signed up to be part of it, and 70 kaiāwhina COVID-19 trained vaccinators have already moved through the programme to be out in the field, with more in training.“Kaiāwhina have embraced the opportunity to learn how to vaccinate so they can help protect their communities.“This programme isalso a boost for the number of Māori and Pacific vaccinators, helping make sure everyone can feel comfortable when they access their shots.“This programme will continue to grow.   That’s important because although more than half of our COVID-19 vaccinators were already experienced vaccinators, including registered nurses, medical practitioners and pharmacists, we recognised we needed to ensure a diverse and growing workforce.“It’s why we’ve developed new pathways to broaden professions and backgrounds.   That approach has increased the size of the vaccinator pool, and broadened its diversity.“Last year, the Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) started provisional vaccinator training, which widened the range of health professionals who could join our COVID-19 vaccinator workforce.“Many have taken up this opportunity, with more than a third of those who’ve completed the Pfizer vaccination training completing the provisional vaccinator course first.“This opened up opportunities for final year student nurses, midwives, pharmacists and paramedics, plus fourth-year onwards medical students to become COVID-19 vaccinators.“Other health professionals have also been able to train, including dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians.“Having heard just a few of the stories motivating our recruits, I’m offering up a huge thanks to everyone.“I would particularly acknowledge the commitment of people like Renee Muru-Barnard and the team of kaiāwhina in South Auckland.  They’re some of the  Kiwis who’ve stepped up to join our largest ever vaccination programme, and to support their communities’ health and wellbeing.“So many people from a wide spectrum of professions and walks of life are taking up the baton to help protect their fellow New Zealanders.“I want to applaud their commitment,” Chris Hipkins said.Profile:  Renee Muru-Barnard, COVID-19 vaccination manager - Turuki HealthcareRenee’s professional background is with Turuki Healthcare, South Auckland“South Auckland is a beautiful place to work in, and I think to have a range of vaccinators there – people who come from all walks of life, who are of all ethnicities – they are able to respond better to the cultural needs of whanau,” says Renee about the team she works with.“I think that’s really important.  I’m from a little place in the Hokianga and when Spanish flu came through, it literally wiped out ourhapū.“And when I think about COVID and the response we need in little towns like that, I thought that if I could jump out and go and help the vaccine effort, then that’s what I wanted to be able to do.”","Publication Date: 10 August 2021

Additional Pfizer vaccines to arrive tomorrow,"More than a quarter of a million additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine are on their way from Spain to New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.The additional doses will arrive in Auckland on Friday morning to help meet the current surge in demand for vaccination.“It’s been heartening to see so many New Zealanders getting vaccinated recently and the additional doses that we have purchased from Spain will help us provide additional capacity and walk-in sites through September,”Jacinda Ardern said.“We’re vaccinating well ahead of plan and these additional vaccines will ensure we can continue to ramp up our vaccination programme.“The Spanish shipment is in addition to New Zealand’s regular weekly delivery from Pfizer which is also expected this weekend.“We expect to receive a total of 1.8 million doses from Pfizer throughout the month of September, in addition to the doses purchased from Spain. This means we don’t have any plans to slow down the rollout.“This is the result of excellent collaboration between officials from New Zealand, Spain, the European Commission and Pfizer to secure this agreement. I wish to say thank you to those involved especially President Pedro Sánchez of Spain.“We are deeply grateful to Spain for their cooperation and agreement to sell these doses to New Zealand. This reaffirms the strong links between our countries and is in the spirit of the global values shared by New Zealand and Spain.“We also wish to extend our appreciation to the European Commission, for coordinating this purchase and to Belgium for their important role in producing the vaccines that New Zealand is the recipient of.“We expect to make a further announcement about an agreement to buy additional Pfizer vaccines from a second country next week,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 9 September 2021

Government funding to fight infectious diseases,"$36 million for research into Covid-19 and other infectious diseasesThe investment will improve our readiness for future pandemicsResearch will focus on prevention, control, and management of infectious diseasesThe Government’s investing in a new Infectious Diseases Research Platform to boost Aotearoa New Zealand’s Covid-19 response and preparedness for future pandemics.“Our response to Covid-19 has been informed by science from the beginning, and as a result we have saved lives,” Associate Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Dr Ayesha Verrall said.“But the lack of a dedicated infectious diseases research fund has been a longstanding gap in our domestic science capabilities. When the pandemic hit, scientists either volunteered time to support the Covid-19 response, or received ad hoc grants for small pieces of research. To address this, we are investing $36 million over three years in a new programme of research to sustain the contribution of cutting-edge science to the response.“The focus will be on major research questions relating to Covid-19, which are common to all infectious diseases. The first priority area is improving prevention and control, including through better understanding of disease transmission, and further vaccine research. The second is in improving our management of infectious diseases, for instance through diagnostics, surveillance and therapeutics.“Reducing the impact of infectious diseases on Māori and Pacific people, and promoting the development of our next generation of pandemic scientists, are key drivers of this work.“This important investment will enable us to sustain the valuable contribution scientists make to the Covid-19 response, improve capability and prepare for future pandemics. It will generate practical collaborations between scientists, the health system, and the pandemic response,” Ayesha Verrall said.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will run an investment process, and will open up for proposals from next month for the platform host.

Workplace vaccination guidance updated,"New guidance to support businesses and organisations through the upcoming changes to vaccination requirements has been released today.The new guidance has been published onwww.worksafe.govt.nzandwww.employment.govt.nzand helps employers update their health and safety risk assessments, reflecting the changes to the COVID-19 Protection Framework (CPF).“With vaccine mandates to narrow on 4 April to only health and disability, aged care, prison and border workforces, we are providing updated guidance now to provide clarity and certainty to employers,” Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood said.“The new workplace guidance is centred on public health advice, which suggests that requiring vaccination in the workplace should only be permitted if it's deemed an employee is at higher risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 while at work, than they would otherwise be in the community.“Employers may still be able to maintain vaccination requirements where they continue to be supported by a workplace health and safety risk assessment, but the reason will need to be specific to their role and set of circumstances.“We would anticipate this will significantly reduce the use of vaccine requirements in most settings and the circumstances are likely to be more limited than they have in the past now that Omicron has entered the community.“Employers should regularly review their workplace health and safety risk assessments and there are a number of public health factors outlined in the guidance that is recommended they consider as part of this process.“It is important for employers to keep in mind that normal employment law and processes continue to apply. Employers should be fair and reasonable in their employment decisions and work in good faith with employees and unions before taking any employment actions in relation to unvaccinated employees.“It is important that employers feel supported during this time of transition. That’s why we have taken the time to develop comprehensive guidance, backed by public health advice that is reliable for employers.“These changes to the CPF have been informed by public health advice, and the latest international evidence available. With our high vaccination rates and the immunity acquired from the current outbreak, we can manage future waves of Omicron with less restrictive settings.“Vaccination (including boosters) continues to be strongly recommended as one of the key public health measures and provides significant benefits.“I recommend that employers undertake an updated work health and safety risk assessment before proceeding with any employment processes they may have already in place.”“It is also important to remember that the majority of New Zealand workplaces have not had a vaccination requirement in place and have managed well over this period.“Throughout the pandemic, employers have shown their ability to adapt and respond to our changing environment while supporting employees. I’d like to thank them for the part they continue to play in keeping New Zealanders safe,” Michael Wood said.","Publication Date: 30 March 2022

AstraZeneca arrives in New Zealand_ second COVID_19 vaccine available this month,"New Zealanders will soon be able to access a second type of COVID-19 vaccine, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said.A shipment of 100,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine arrived in New Zealand today from Australia.“Enough for 50,000 people, these doses are for people who can’t have the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons, and for those who would like an option other than the Pfizer vaccine,” Chris Hipkins said.“From 26 November, anyone aged 18 and older who wishes to have the AstraZeneca vaccine will be able to book an appointment onBookMyVaccine.nzor by calling Healthline.“DHBs are preparing to offer the AstraZeneca vaccine, including arranging for specific clinics to administer the vaccine, and making sure the workforce is trained to deliver it.“AstraZeneca will be available at a limited number of sites across the country as Pfizer is the main COVID-19 vaccine we are using in New Zealand.“Officials have also been working closely with colleagues in Australia and with AstraZeneca to secure delivery of these doses from the manufacturer in Melbourne.“We want to thank the Australian Government for their cooperation in providing timely access to these doses and AstraZeneca for their support of this arrangement.“New Zealand has an advance purchase agreement with AstraZeneca for 7.6 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The 100,000 doses which have arrived from Australia are part of this original purchase agreement. The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group provided advice to Cabinet this week on the use of the vaccine in New Zealand. Cabinet has since granted a ‘decision to use’.“Pfizer remains the preferred COVID-19 vaccine for use in New Zealand and we have enough vaccine supply for everyone to be vaccinated,” Chris Hipkins said.“Looking at today’s case numbers, and the current geographical spread, I can’t stress enough how important it is that we have as many people as possible vaccinated.“Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves, our whānau and our communities against COVID-19.”","Publication Date: 18 November 2021

Covid_19 immigration powers to be extended,"Temporary COVID-19 immigration powers will be extended to May 2023, providing continued flexibility to support migrants, manage the border, and help industries facing labour shortages, Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi announced today.“Over the past year, we have had to make rapid decisions to vary visa conditions, extend expiry dates, and waive some application requirements across entire visa categories. These decisions have provided more flexibility and certainty to visa holders and employers in New Zealand, and made more migrants availablefor industries facing labour shortages in a time when New Zealand’s Covid-19 health response needed our borders to be closed,” said Kris Faafoi.“We have been able to make these necessary changes under the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Bill, which expires in May 2021.“Today, I have introduced a Bill to maintain those powers until 2023.“The Bill will go through a short Select Committee process and is expected to pass in May.”Immigration Ministers have used the powers to benefit classes of migrants 18 times, including:Extending visas for 22,500 workers and families members to give more certainty to them and their employersProviding 5,600 offshore resident visa holders more time to come to New Zealand and activate their visasExtending 16,600 visitor visas to give people more time to secure ways to return home, and allowing all visitors the opportunity to study or attend school while hereExtending 7,800 working holiday visas and easing conditions to allow holders to work in industries like horticultureWaiving certain application requirements for transit passengers and, more recently, for RSE workers“New Zealand is making good progress on the vaccines roll out. More will be announced next week regarding a travel bubble with Australia. And we continue to prepare for the eventual safe re-opening of our borders. But we know that COVID-19 is still widespread overseas, and it will take time for other countries to get the virus and its variants under control.“The extension to 2023 ensures our immigration system can continue to be responsive and flexible, if needed, over the next couple of years.“The Bill keeps in place existing safeguards. The powers can only be used for COVID-19 related matters and generally must benefit – or at a minimum, not disadvantage – visa holders,” Kris Faafoi said.","Publication Date: 1 April 2021

Govt reminds international arrivals to test for Covid,"The Government is reiterating its advice to all international travellers to do a Covid test if they become symptomatic after arrival, while also stepping up awareness of free RATs available at airports, Covid-19 Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall says.“This follows growing global concerns, including from the World Health Organisation (WHO) about lack of reliable data on case numbers in China and their work to address this,” Ayesha Verrall said.“In response, officials have done a public health risk assessment including working through scenarios of potential case numbers among travellers from China. This confirmed these visitors won’t contribute significantly to our Covid case numbers meaning entry restrictions aren’t required or justified.“There is minimal public health risk to New Zealand. We know that BF7 is the prevalent variant in China and that it hasn’t caused significant outbreaks in other countries that, like New Zealand, have already been exposed to the BA5 variant. So public health measures are not required to protect New Zealanders.“However we do share the WHO’s concerns about lack of information sharing and this is why we will be asking travellers arriving from China to help us gather more information. In coming weeks we will temporarily be emailing a random sample of people recently arrived from China to ask them to undertake a RAT test and share that information with health authorities. It’s entirely voluntary and we have had high uptake from international visitors when we used this method before.“It is important to note that new Covid variants can arise from across the world, not just China, which is why we’re reminding arrivals from all countries to take the free RATs at the airport and test if they develop symptoms once in New Zealand.“In coming weeks, ESR scientists will also pilot testing of waste water from international flights and assess the feasibility of this method replacing the targeted and temporary voluntary testing that we’ve announced today for travellers from China.“To conclude, being up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination – including with your booster vaccination, continues to be your best protection against hospitalisation and severe disease. The current vaccines remain effective at reducing risk of severe disease if you are infected with any of the variants currently circulating.“New Zealand continues to welcome visitors and tourists, and we ask that everyone follows the current public health measures which include staying home if you are unwell and isolating if you test positive for COVID-19,” Ayesha Verrall said.","Publication Date: 4 January 2023

Second COVID_19 vaccine booster for the most vulnerable,"Second COVID-19 booster recommended for the most vulnerable 6 months after first boosterSeveral hundred thousand people will be eligibleLegislative change to enable rollout from mid-JunePeople who are at high-risk of getting very sick from a COVID-19 infection will soon be eligible to receive a second booster, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.This follows a recommendation from the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group that a second booster dose may be beneficial for those most at-risk of serious illness from COVID-19 and with a gap of six months from their previous booster. The vast majority of these people become eligible from July.“A booster is important for our most vulnerable as we move into the winter peak. Several hundred thousand people will be eligible, which includes our older population, residents of aged care facilities, disability care facilities aged 16 years and over, and severely immunocompromised people aged 16 years and over and who have received a three-dose primary course and a first booster.“Final decisions on the make-up of this group will be made within the next two weeks.“The Government is working urgently to enable the second booster to be made available in the same way as the primary course and booster – that is, without needing to access a GP. This will be more equitable and make the roll-out to our at-risk groups more effective.“We intend do this by amending the Medicines Act, and anticipate the new policy will be in effect from mid June, in good time for the vast majority of eligible people.“If you are eligible but have had COVID-19, you will need to wait at least 3 months after your infection before having an additional dose.“Based on current advice, for those who are not at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, a two-dose primary course and a booster dose provides very good and lasting protection, which is why we can be more targeted in the rollout of the second booster.“We know a booster helps reduce the chance of more serious infection, and it will be less likely that you need hospitalisation. And if you haven’t had your first booster yet, it is not too late to get it in time for the winter season.“The Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group will continue to review new information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines and will make further recommendations if necessary,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 27 May 2022

Government invests to support a classic Kiwi summer,"Vaccinated New Zealanders can look forward to Kiwi summer events with confidence, while artists and crew will have more certainty, following the launch of details of the Arts and Culture Event Support Scheme, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Carmel Sepuloni announced today.“The Government recognises that the arts and culture sector has been hit hard by COVID-19 and the Delta outbreak. The pandemic continues to pose challenges for the sector, especially live events and performances during summer,” Carmel Sepuloni said.“ThisArts and Culture Event SupportScheme is about providing certainty for event organisers, confidence for vaccinated New Zealanders to attend and enjoy events, and reassurance for artists and crew that they can get paid if their events can’t go ahead as planned.“I know that artists, crew and organisers are all eager to get back to doing what they love – putting on great events of all sizes and scope for New Zealanders. Knowing that this scheme exists to support them will be a big help over coming months.”The Arts and Culture Event Support Schemecovers events with attendee capacity of 100-5000 ticketed or un-ticketed, or more than 5000 un-ticketed (i.e. free). The scheme covers unrecoverable costs, payments yet to be made to the likes of artists and production crew, and reasonable costs to the promoter or organiser for the planning and development of the event.“We’ve engaged closely with ourarts and culturesector to develop the scheme, and we’ll continue to work closely with the sector to ensure organisers know when, where and how to access the support they need.“Events will need to use the Government’s My Vaccine Pass, in order to be eligible for the scheme. This is particularly important so that other vaccinated New Zealanders can enjoy confidence that the events they’ll attend will be as safe as possible.“Arts and culture are critically important to our economy. Our $374 million COVID recovery package for the sector, including the $37.5 million Emergency Relief Package announced in September, underlines the social, economic and cultural value of the sector.“I encourage New Zealanders to get out, enjoy the Kiwi summer and the freedoms it’ll bring, book tickets, make plans to attend events and support local artists, musicians and shows“We all deserve to enjoy summer in Aotearoa with certainty and confidence. That’s what this scheme is about and aims to guarantee,” Carmel Sepuloni said.The registration process opens at 12pm Wednesday December 1.Event organisers need to register their event with MCH as soon as possible, so they can confirm their event’s eligibility before their event date.To register for the scheme, please visitthis page on the Manatū Taonga website.","Publication Date: 30 November 2021

We now have 1,009,536 vaccinations booked in the system. Over the last three days the 0800 call centre handled 27,695 calls with an average wait time of less than 1 minute.“This is a great all round response and means we’re in position to open the 50-plus age band for vaccinations earlier than planned.“People in the 50-plus group who are eligible don’t have to wait to receive an invitation.

COVID_19 Information vital to Māori vaccination and immunisation programme,"Getting the right information is an important part of the process for whānau, hapū and iwi to be ready for the COVID-19 vaccination, Associate Minister for Health (Māori) Hon Peeni Henare said.“We are seeing progress in our communities to ensure Māori have the information and tools needed to make informed choices about the COVID-19 vaccine.“I visited a number of rohe over the last couple of months and I am heartened to see the efforts being made by iwi, and hauora providers with the support of local health practitioners to ensure whānau have quality information about the vaccine,” Peeni Henare said.In March the Government confirmed the timing and sequencing of an initial $39 million to ensure the COVID-19 programme had a strong focus on protecting Māori whānau and preparing Māori communities for the roll out of the COVID-19 programme.Of the $39 million there is $24.5 million for the development of community-based vaccine support services. This is allocated to a mix of vaccine support services for navigators, coordinators, champions across rangatahi, whānau and community, and options for virtual support networks.Feedback from my visits and korero with Māori showed that there were still many of our whānau who needed more information and they took the opportunity to ask questions about the vaccination roll out including safety pātai, whether the vaccine is free and when whānau could get vaccinated.Māori providers have a vital role in ensuring a whānau-centred approach to make it easier for whānau, hapū and iwi to get vaccinated. The $11 million allocated to the Māori provider fund for provider readiness will see more than 60 Māori vaccination providers delivering services across Aotearoa. Over half of those providers have already been contracted through the Ministry of Health with the remainder expected to be contracted as the programme scales up.“We now over 500 Māori trained as vaccinators with 150 already active in this kaupapa. We also have more than 26,000 Māori who have received their first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and over 11,000 who have received their second dose.“As we get closer to the next phase of the vaccination roll out we want to make sure that our people have access to information that is relevant to them in their rohe and kainga to make a confident and informed decisionThat’s why we allocated $2 million for by Māori for Māori communications,” he said.The fund enables a local communications response to inform iwi, whānau, hapū or hapori about the COVID-19 vaccination programme. A contestable fund of $1.5 million received 57 applications, representing 140 organisations, iwi and hapū. The remaining $500,000 is allocated to the Iwi Communications Collective - 43 iwi communications practitioners working with, and for, their respective, iwi, hapū and whānau throughout Aotearoa.While our communities will be working on communications locally and regionally, there is also a greater Māori information sharing presence online. The Ministry of Health You Tube site has a series of videos hosted by Dr Lily Fraser. TheStraight Up seriessees whānau raise their pātai about the vaccine. Te Puni Kōkiri also launchedwww.karawhuia.nz, a new site with trusted information to assist whānau to make informed choices about the vaccine and a linked advertising campaign.“As the vaccine becomes available to more groups, and all of Aotearoa from July, ensure you have the information you need to play your part in protecting our whānau, hapū, iwi, and whakapapa""added Minister Henare.Media contact:Irena Smith 021 845 205NOTES TO THE EDITOR:$24.5m is broken down into three components:$17.5m for vaccine support service which includes navigators and coordinators. This funding has been allocated to DHBs with baseline funding of 20 percent and 80 percent based on PBFF (Population based funding formula). This funding is for FTE support which will go directly to Māori Health Providers.$5.6m is for a virtual support network or Telehealth type service.$1.4m is for community champions. Discussions are being held on how to allocate this funding and the mix i.e. iwi, youth, whānau, community.","Publication Date: 26 May 2021

One million New Zealanders vaccinated against flu,"More than a million New Zealanders have already received their flu vaccine in time for  winter, but we need lots more to get vaccinated to help relieve pressure on the health system, Health Minister Andrew Little says.“Getting to one million doses by June is a significant milestone and sits closely behind the record 1.1 million doses administered in all of 2020,” Andrew Little said.“New Zealanders have stepped up to protect themselves and their communities by being vaccinated against both COVID-19 and the flu.“But with significant pressure on our health system over winter it’s important everyone eligible for a free flu jab gets one so there’s a hospital bed available for everyone who needs one.“With international travel ramping up again and new flu strains entering the country this winter is already turning out to be a tougher flu season than usual.“Currently influenza makes up around one third of hospital admissions. We can help reduce that by increasing vaccination rates even further.“Around 64 percent of New Zealanders aged 65 and over have had their flu vaccine. This is the group most likely to end up in hospital so it would be great to get that number even higher.“The government has stepped up by funding free flu immunisations for over-65s, pregnant women, Māori and Pacific people who are aged over 55, patient and client-facing health and community care workers, and people with health conditions that put them at higher risk.“If you’re in one of these groups and haven’t had your flu jab yet then it’s really important to get it now before the winter chills strike. Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves from getting sick, and from making others around us sick.“People can get vaccinated at GP practices, pharmacies and many COVID-19 vaccination centres around all around New Zealand. Many employers offer free or subsidised flu jabs for their staff,” Andrew Little said.Note: More information about influenza vaccination is available athttps://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/influenza/flu-influenza-vaccines","Publication Date: 16 June 2022

Government backs critical health research,"Research into some of New Zealanders’ biggest health concerns including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease is getting crucial support in the latest round of health research funding, Health Minister Andrew Little announced today.The funding, awarded through the Health Research Council of New Zealand, covers 31 General Project grants ($36.64 million), five Rangahau Hauora Māori grants ($5.91 million), five Pacific Project grants ($5.79 million), and four Programme grants ($19.99 million).“The Government is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders, and research is a vital part of the plan,” Andrew Little said.“This significant investment has the potential to vastly improve the health of New Zealanders.“The research will investigate issuesranging from vaccine hesitancy through to improving genetic diagnoses for tamariki across Aotearoa,” Andrew Little said.Included among the successful applications are projects led by Māori and Pacific researchers and driven by Kaupapa Māori and Pacific research methodologies that will help to reduce inequities in health for Māori and Pacific peoples.One of the researchers receiving a grant in today’s announcement is Dr Jason Gurney (Ngāpuhi) whoholds an HRC Māori Health Research Emerging Leader Fellowship. He is being awarded nearly $800,000 to explore the growing crisis of diabetes and cancer co-occurrence and its impact on what happens to people with cancer.The epidemiologist and senior research fellow at the University of Otago in Wellington wants to improve the quantity and quality of life for Māori and Pacific peoples who develop the diseases.The two-year research project is a collaboration between the C3 Research Group and Professor Ross Lawrenson’s research group at the University of Waikato. It will explore the rapidly increasing rates of diabetes and cancer within Māori and Pasifika populations, and the impact of it becoming increasingly common for one person to have both conditions.“As I said earlier this year when I announced major reform of the health system, Māori and Pacific peoples are twice as likely to die young from conditions that could have been treated, and being Māori or Pacific even determines what sort of treatment you get.“Our plan for dealing with this includes looking at why that is happening and finding effective ways to deal with it. Dr Gurney’s research will help, and will also allow us to predict how many people are likely to have both diseases in future so we can plan for that.“The projects funded this year show New Zealand developing innovative approaches that will have an immediate effect on the health system, and that it has an agile and capable research sector that can respond to community needs and emerging health threats,” Andrew Little said.More information and the full list of successful projects can be found on the Health Research Council’swebsite.Background for editors:The Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC) is responsible for managing the Government’s investment in health research.Each year the HRC offers funding for Projects, Pacific Projects and Programmes through an annual contestable funding round, awarding grants of approximately $1.2 million and up to $5 million for each successful proposal. Funded projects and programmes have a strategic, long-term vision that will contribute to significantly improving health outcomes for New Zealanders.This year’s projects, to highlight a few, will:explore how the health system can better support and achieve health equity;gauge why some New Zealanders are refusing or delaying vaccinations;help boost immunity to the highly contagious disease measles in young adults;focus on more equitable access for lung cancer screening for Māori; andassess methods to help people quit smoking.The Health Research Council of New Zealandinvestsaround$120 million a year in research that improves the quality, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of New Zealand’s health system, and contributes to disease prevention and living well.","Publication Date: 27 July 2021

More medicines for more New Zealanders,"Spinraza to be funded for young people with spinal muscular atrophy.Free meningococcal vaccine for more people.Capsule instead of intravenous chemotherapy for hundreds of cancer patients.The Government is welcomingnewsthat more important medicines are to be publicly funded, thanks to a major increase in the budget of the national medicines-buying agency Pharmac.“Today’s announcement that Pharmac will fully fund Spinraza for people under the age of 18 is great news,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.“Spinraza is the first medicine for spinal muscular atrophy to be funded, and has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of the young people who receive it.“Coming on top of Pharmac’sannouncement on Sundaythat it proposes funding Trikafta for people with cystic fibrosis, this is real evidence that the extra money we’re putting into the health system and into medicines is paying real dividends for people with rare diseases.“Since being elected in 2017, the Labour Government has increased the pharmaceuticals budget by 43 per cent, including an extra $71 million this year and $120 million next year, making more than 200 medicines and vaccines available to more people.“I have also directed the Ministry of Health to develop the country’s first rare disorders strategy, as recommended by the Pharmac Review panel, and I am pleased that Pharmac is using the extra funding we’ve provided to make medicines available for people with rare diseases.”Pharmac also announced today that it is widening free access to the meningococcal B vaccine to include babies and young people living in places like hostels where they are in close contact with other people, and confirmed it will fund an oral version of a cancer medicine.“Being able to get vinorelbine as a capsule that you can take at home instead of having to travel to a hospital for intravenous chemotherapy will make life easier for hundreds of cancer patients,” Andrew Little said.“Vinorelbine is used to treat lung and breast cancer, as well as some non-cancerous growths, so making it available as an oral treatment will be a real benefit to rural people especially, who often find it difficult to get to places where infusion services are delivered.“The Government’s increase in the pharmaceuticals budget since 2017 has allowed Pharmac to fund 70 new medicines and widen access to another 134, with many more to come,” Andrew Little said.","Publication Date: 8 December 2022

Half a million Pfizer vaccines from Denmark,"The Government has secured an extra half a million doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines from Denmark that will start arriving in New Zealand within days, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.“This is the second and larger agreement the Government has entered into to purchase additional vaccines to meet the significantly increased demand through September before our large shipments land in October,” Jacinda Ardern said.“These doses along with the 275,000 doses purchased from Spain last week provide an additional 775,000 to New Zealand’s vaccine supplies.“There is now more than enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate at the world leading rates we were hitting earlier in the month, and I strongly encourage every New Zealander not yet vaccinated to do so as soon as possible.“We are extremely grateful to Denmark for making these vaccines available to help protect Aotearoa New Zealand against the current Delta outbreak.“Our sincere gratitude is extended to Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her officials for their agreement and assistance to sell these doses to New Zealand. I wish to thank the European Commission for coordinating this purchase, as well as Belgium, for their role in producing the vaccine.“Throughout the pandemic the team of 5 million has shown their commitment to keeping our communities safe. In 2020 we stayed home to save lives, in 2021 we need everyone to get vaccinated to protect family and loved ones and to prevent future lockdowns.“76% of people aged 12 and older are either booked or have received their first dose, but we can’t get complacent. Other countries with higher rates than this are still experiencing outbreaks, so we need to get vaccination rates up around the country and this extra supply will help with that.“This extra supply means we can continue to roll out vaccines well ahead of plan, so that everyone in New Zealand over the age of 12 can be vaccinated as soon as possible for free,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 12 September 2021

Such political consultations and exchanges of information will have a special focus on global governance; global political and security issues of shared concern; and regional matters (in particular, in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa).Together we will continue to work towards the prompt conclusion of bilateral agreements and arrangements under negotiation, in particular the Arrangement on Antarctic Cooperation.2. Global Values PartnershipNew Zealand and Spain share a vision for the world we want to shape together. Our countries are globally oriented and seek to advance a rules-based international order through more and better multilateral cooperation. We both encourage and celebrate diversity. We are determined to advance in our foreign policies the goals of inclusive and more egalitarian societies; a sustainable, greener economy; and vibrant, resilient democracies where pluralism thrives and is reinforced by the technological revolution.The Global Values Partnership, co-led by New Zealand and Spain, will put such values-driven policies at the forefront of our transformative foreign agendas. By launching the Global Values Partnership, Spain and New Zealand will coordinate more closely their efforts to address global challenges and advance an agenda of reinforced multilateralism. We will seek opportunities to speak out together, and with others, carrying out joint, concrete actions in defence of our modern, democratic and internationalist values.3. Multilateral actionsNew Zealand and Spain will continue our strong record of working together multilaterally, including by:Promoting global peace and security, responding to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, including online through our continuous support and endorsement of the Christchurch Call to Action.Promoting and protecting human rights and gender equality through support for multilateral and regional human rights processes, and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.Strengthening the United Nations system so that it better addresses global challenges through concrete actions such as the initiative “Reinforcing Multilateralism Together”, launched in Madrid on November 2020.Promoting respect for international law, including international humanitarian law; supporting international courts and others mechanisms to ensure full accountability for violations of international law, particularly international crimes, human rights violations and the use of chemical weapons; and upholding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which sets out the definitive legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.Enhancing regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America and Africa.Working together in support of Pacific Island countries including in taking ambitious action on climate change, amplifying Small Island Developing States’ voices in multilateral fora, and regularly consulting on Pacific issues, including in relation to the European Union’s contribution in the Pacific.4. Economy, Trade, Business, Investment, and TechnologyGlobalisation has enhanced connectivity between our two countries, brought prosperity to our societies, and improved the lives of millions. It has also posed challenges, and we must bring a broader perspective to economic transformation that puts at the forefront social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and gender perspectives looking for a level playing field for all.International trade and investment, within multilateral rules, has created an international economic order that has benefitted our economies. This order should be adapted and modernised to ensure it continues to work for all in the 21st Century. We strongly support the World Trade Organisation, its new leadership, and efforts to deliver concrete outcomes and a pathway for meaningful reform.We support the conclusion of negotiations for a comprehensive, balanced, sustainable and ambitious European Union-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement. We are convinced that it will provide increased opportunities for trade and investment between our two countries, and could serve as a new-generation model for future free trade agreements in the world.We will foster greater knowledge and interaction between our respective business communities, including through two-way business delegation missions where possible. We will encourage continued trade and investment links between our two countries and a free flow of visits and contacts whenever possible.Digital technologies are having far-reaching impacts on our economies and societies. We will work together, including within the Christchurch Call to Action and in other relevant fora, to promote a free, open and secure internet, to advance a fair, inclusive digital transformation. We will strive to reach an ambitious, consensus-based solution on digital taxation within the OECD that ensures a fairer global fiscal regime.5. COVID-19 RecoveryTogether we will continue to advocate for sufficient production and equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines. We will continue to support the ACT-Accelerator and the COVAX facility, including through donating vaccines from our respective domestic portfolios. The world needs to increase global vaccine production capacity, ensure smooth supply chains, and remove trade barriers and logistical hurdles, ensuring universal access to vaccines as quickly as possible. Intellectual property rights should be part of the solution towards achieving universal access to vaccines, including through a temporary waiver.Our efforts in this respect will also benefit the access to vaccines for other transmissible diseases. Through our joint constituency of the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), we will continue to promote access to vaccines for children in the world’s least developed countries. Together we will focus in particular on gender equality, vulnerable groups, Small Island Developing States, fragile states, and reducing barriers to vaccine access.The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased inequalities and fostered more geo-economic competition. In the short term,restoring a safe international mobility and ensuring adequate support to vulnerable sectors particularly hit by the crisis are key priorities. The impact of the pandemic alsoprovides an opportunity to build back better. Together, we will therefore advocate for a comprehensive green economic recovery that focuses on building sustainable, inclusive, carbon neutral, digital economies.This is also the moment to strengthen the global health system, adapting it to ensure the world is better prepared for any future global health emergency. We will closely consider the recommendations made in the final report of the Independent Panel commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO).Maintaining open trade flows in COVID-19 related essential goods is in our mutual interest, in particular critical medical supplies, vaccines and vaccine-related equipment.  We will share experience and knowledge on trade in COVID-19 related goods and on strengthening the future resilience of our global supply chain connections.6. Climate Change and EnvironmentAs we get ready for what must be an ambitious COP 26, we will deepen dialogue and our cooperation on climate change, recognising the urgency of climate action to meet the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal, including jointly advocating for international action to limit temperature to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.We will continue to work closely through the Carbon Neutrality Coalition, and to promote action on agricultural emissions through the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. We reaffirm our joint commitment to rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, recalling in particular Sustainable Development Goal target 12.C.7. Antarctica and oceansWe will coordinate closely on Antarctic issues, including the advancement of our shared focus on conservation of Antarctic marine ecosystems. We welcome the announcement of an international meeting in Madrid in October 2021 to mark the 30thAnniversary of the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection. We will also continue to coordinate closely on issues related to the ocean, including seabird conservation, particularly albatross and petrels.8. People to people, culture, education and sportsSpain and New Zealand are committed to advocating for gender equality and women’s empowerment; this includes promoting women’s leadership in our societies and their full participation in politics and institutions.Both our countries cherish the common values that sport helps to promote in our communities: team building, fair play, mutual respect, inclusivity, open participation and common rules. We recognise the contribution of sport to the relationship between our two countries and our people. We will make the most of opportunities to promote these shared values together through events such as FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023, being co-hosted in New Zealand, and the Ocean Race 2022 that will start from Spain.The Memorandum of Cooperation on Education of 2010 has been the base for the promotion of Spanish language in New Zealand and for engagement of New Zealand in English language programmes in Spain. We will continue to explore options for more cooperation in the field of language education, exchange of language and culture assistants and support the work of the Cervantes Institute, the Prince of Asturias Chair at the University of Auckland, and Casa Asia, to further mutual cultural interaction and enrichment.We are also committed to fostering better mutual understanding through travel and contacts, especially among young people.","Publication Date: 2 June 2021

New Zealand provides additional funding to COVAX for vaccine delivery,"Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta today announced additional funding will be provided to COVAX to support vaccine delivery in developing countries.“New Zealand remains cognisant of the dangers of COVID-19, especially as new variants continue to emerge. No one is safe from this virus until we all are and this funding will mean more people in developing countries will be able to protect themselves and their families at this crucial time,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“Aotearoa New Zealand is contributing a further $9 million to the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) to ensure developing countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines.“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained that equity of access to vaccinations must be a core feature of a global response. Our ongoing contribution reinforces our view that developing nations should not be hindered in their ability to fight the severe impacts of this virus on the health of their people and communities.“As one of the first countries to donate funds and vaccines to COVAX, we are a strong supporter of their efforts in ensuring widespread vaccination around the world,” Nanaia Mahuta said.This funding brings New Zealand’s total COVAX AMC contribution to $26 million.COVAX is the only global initiative working with manufacturers and governments to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both high-income and lower-income countries. It is co-led by CEPI, Gavi and WHO – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others.","Publication Date: 1 December 2021

New award recognises MIQ staff,"The Government is establishing an award to recognise people who have contributed to New Zealand’s COVID-19 response, with MIQ staff to be the first recipients, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.“The award provides a formal opportunity to acknowledge those who have played a critical role in our COVID-19 response,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Our MIQ workforce has demonstrated care and professionalism, often at considerable personal risk and sacrifice and are worthy recipients of this award and our gratitude.“MIQ workers have welcomed home over 230,000 Kiwis and supported more than 4,400 people from within our community who have had Covid-19. They have been a core part of our wall of defence against COVID-19.“It’s easy to hear the word MIQ and immediately associate it with heartache. There is no question, that for New Zealand it has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic. But the staff who worked in the facilities did so selflessly and deserve our thanks.“MIQ staff have been at the front line of COVID-19 from the start. Prior to the vaccine they had no way to protect themselves from the virus other than PPE.“Working in MIQ often meant giving up on normal lives to protect others. I’ve heard stories of staff being ostracised through fear of infection and isolating and changing their normal routines to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to others.“I can’t imagine the burden they have carried and this recognition is the least we can do to thank them for their service and sacrifice.“The award will take the form of a lapel pin. Officials are working on design, eligibility and criteria with further details to come as the work progresses.“This award to the MIQ workforce is the first to be announced. Recognition will be extended to other groups who have contributed to New Zealand’s COVID-19 response, with further announcements to be made in due course.“Our COVID-19 response has and continues to be a true team effort that is not over, but the Government wants to ensure those on the frontline get the recognition they deserve for what they helped achieve,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 10 March 2022

Traffic light levels announced,"The levels at which different parts of New Zealand will move forward into the COVID-19 Protection Framework this Friday have been announced.Northland, Auckland, Taupō and Rotorua Lakes Districts, Kawerau, Whakatane, Ōpōtiki Districts, Gisborne District, Wairoa District, Rangitikei, Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts will move in at RedThe rest of the North Island will move in at OrangeThe whole of the South Island will move in at OrangeCautious approach taken initially as we transition into the new framework“On Friday the traffic lights are turned on for all of New Zealand, as we move forward safely into the next phase of our world-leading COVID-19 response,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.“We’ve prepared well for this moment by maintaining a cautious approach focused on protecting people and their jobs. Our next phase is focused on minimising the impact of COVID-19 and protecting people.“We’ve vaccinated a significant portion of the team of 5 million, and now is the time to move to a new framework.“We’ve come through the past two years of COVID in better shape than nearly anywhere in the world, with the lowest case and death rates in the OECD, a growing economy, and among the highest rates of vaccination in the world.“We’re now in the strongest position to move forward into the next phase.“The certainty and stability of the traffic lights replaces the sudden lockdowns and restrictions of Alert Levels. Our schools will stay open at every colour and businesses will have protection through My Vaccine Passes to keep operating.“Other than the existing Auckland boundary, which lifts on January 17, there will be no new restrictions on travel between regions.“Vaccinated New Zealanders using vaccine passes will be able to do many of the things that were previously treated as high risk like safely going to bars and restaurants, getting a haircut, and going to a concert or the gym. In Auckland, it means seeing friends and family indoors again.“But there is more to do. There are 160,889 Kiwis due for a second dose – if everyone got it this week we would be at 89.3 per cent fully vaccinated. I encourage those people to get their second dose today to benefit from the full protection of the vaccine, and to be able to get their Vaccine Pass.“Red is the highest level in the new system, which is why Auckland has moved in at Red as the epicentre of the current outbreak, and we’ve taken strong account of vaccination rates and vulnerable populations in the other regions at Red.“Red provides extra protections against COVID-19 such as requiring both Vaccine Passes and some capacity limits in the most-high risk settings – that’s because if someone has COVID-19, the virus will find it harder to spread among fewer people who are at a distance.“As we see what happens to cases and vaccination levels we can look to move regions down to Orange over time, where there are no gathering limits for those who are using vaccine passes.“We are not moving any regions to Green immediately while we continue to get vaccination rates up and transition the country to the new framework. To achieve this, $120 million continues to be distributed to support Māori communities to fast-track vaccination efforts and prepare for the traffic light system.“But COVID-19 is still with us, and the emergence of the Omicron variant overseas is a reminder of why we need to maintain a careful approach and keep public health measures in place to protect us.“We have been cautious with this initial designation of traffic lights as the new framework beds in. Cabinet will review settings and provide an update on Monday 13 December. The next update by Ministers will be on Monday 17 January, and will continue on a fortnightly basis.“The factors considered when setting the colours in each region include vaccination, the state of the health system, testing, contact tracing and case management capacity, as well as the rate and effect of COVID-19 transmission.“With 85 percent of New Zealanders now fully vaccinated, 92 percent with their first dose and boosters being already rolled out, we are ready to move forward in our next stage of the COVID response.“Thank you New Zealand. We’re getting through our toughest period to date, it’s been long but we’re well set to move forward with caution into the traffic lights, into summer, into 2022, and beyond,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 29 November 2021

More free flu vaccines and a second COVID_19 booster to groups at risk of hospitalisation,"The Government has widened access to free flu vaccines with an extra 800,000 New Zealanders eligible from this Friday, July 1Children aged 3-12 years and people with serious mental health or addiction needs now eligible for free flu dose.From tomorrow (Tuesday), second COVID-19 booster available six months after the first booster for older New Zealanders and other groups.The Government is ramping up access to free flu vaccines and COVID-19 booster shots for those groups of people who are being admitted in increasing numbers to hospital, Health Minister Andrew Little announced today.“We’re making free flu shots available to another 800,000 New Zealanders, including children, more of whom are having to go to hospital,” Andrew Little said.“Free flu shots are already available for everyone over the age of 65 and those at risk of becoming seriously ill or who have underlying conditions.“This season we ordered 40 per cent more vaccines. We’ve already seen more than one million New Zealanders get a flu shot, but with significant pressure on our health system we’re ramping up efforts to get as many people vaccinated as possible.“In recent weeks we have seen a number of pre-school children hospitalised with the flu. We also know children can be transmitters of the flu to others in their family who are more at risk, so it makes sense to reduce transmission as much as we can.“We also know that people with serious mental health or addiction needs can get seriously sick from the flu, which is why we’re also extending flu vaccinations to this group this year.“The extension of the free flu vaccination to more at-risk New Zealanders is just one of the actions we are taking to reduce pressure on our health system this winter,” Andrew Little said.COVID-19 Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said a second COVID-19 booster was available for everyone over the age of 50 and recommended for anyone over the age of 65, as well as Māori and Pacific peoples older than 50 and people who are severely immunocompromised.“The availability of the second booster has also been extended to health, aged-care and disability workers over the age of 30,” Dr Verrall said.“For those not at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, a two-dose primary course and one booster continues to provide very good protection.So, for thosewho haven’t had a first booster, please act now.”The second booster dose should be offered six months after the previous dose, and postponed for three months after a COVID-19 infection.A second booster dose is not recommended for anyone who is pregnant and is healthy, including those with no underlying health conditions which could increase the risk of severe COVID-19.“Staying up-to-date with the recommended COVID-19 vaccinations will continue to protect you from the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation or death,” Dr Verrall said.“The Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group will continue to review new information on COVID-19 and vaccines and will make further recommendations on eligibility criteria as necessary.“The combination of Omicron and flu is making this winter more challenging than normal. The best thing New Zealanders can do to ensure they and their families don’t end up in hospital is to be up-to-date with their flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters,” Dr Verrall said.Anyone who is eligible for a second booster can get one without a prescription from a range of places, including walk-in and drive-through vaccination centres, booking online usingBookMyVaccineor by calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline on 0800 282926. Flu shots are available by booking with GPs or local pharmacies.Notes for EditorsFLUAs well as the expanded criteria for funded flu vaccinations announced today, flu vaccinations are also free for people aged 65 and over,Māori and Pacific people aged 55 and over, anyone who is pregnant and people with underlying health issues like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease.A record two million doses of flu vaccine are available this year, and so far just over a million people have been vaccinated.The widened eligibility criteria means more than 800,000 more  people can now get free vaccinations – about 655,000 children and 170,000 people with serious mental health and addiction needs.Funding for three to 12-year-olds is for the 2022 flu season, while funding for people with serious mental health or addiction issues will be ongoing for future flu seasons.Those with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder or anyone currently accessing secondary or tertiary mental health and addiction services, will now be eligible for 2022 and future seasons.Walk-in vaccination options can be found viawww.health.govt.nz/fluand can get a flu jab from your doctor or usual healthcare provider, and at most pharmacies.COVID-19 Second BoosterThe second COVID-19 booster is available for everyone 50 years and older, and health, aged-care and disability-care workers over the age of 30 once six months has passed since a previous dose.The second dose is recommended six months since their previous for:People aged 65 years and over.Māori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and over.Residents of aged-care and disability-care facilities.Severely immunocompromised people who received a three-dose primary course and a fourth dose as a first booster (noting this would be a fifth dose for these people).People aged 16 years and over who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe breakthrough COVID-19 illness.Disabled people aged 16 years and over with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19.COVID-19 vaccinations, including the second booster, can be booked throughBook My Vaccineor by calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline on 0800 28 29 26 (8am to 8pm, 7 days a week).Walk-in vaccination options can be found viaHealthpointand theUnite Against Covidwebsite.If you have COVID-19 recently you should delay your next scheduled COVID-19 vaccination for three months, however there is no need to defer your flu vaccination.","Publication Date: 27 June 2022

Strong Government books leave New Zealand well placed amid global challenges,"Deficit half of forecast at $9.7 billion; Deficits as a percentage of GDP running better than during GFCNet debt at 17.2 percent of GDP lower than Australia, UK, US and Canada.Core expenses $2.8 billion lower than forecast. Increased expenditure during year due to COVID-related expenses through unprecedented Delta and Omicron outbreaksStrong result allows for ongoing investment in core services like health, education and housing to occur amid worsening global economic challengesThe Government has delivered a set of books that are among the strongest in the world, ending the 2021/2022 fiscal year in a stronger position than forecast and ensuring New Zealand is well placed to respond to an increasingly volatile global economy.For the year to the end of June 2022, the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) recorded a deficit of $9.7 billion, roughly half of what was forecast just months ago at Budget 2022.“We’ve delivered Government books that not only compare favourably with the comparable stage during the Global Financial Crisis, but across the key economic measures of growth, unemployment and Government debt we’re in a better or similar position to the likes of Australia, the US, UK and Canada,” Grant Robertson said.“On the measures that matter the Government has steered the New Zealand economy and Government books through the 1-in-100 year economic shock of the pandemic favourably compared to the GFC – our economy has bounced back quicker, unemployment is lower, and the increase in debt compared to the size of the economy is comparable.“Our Wellbeing Approach has also seen significant reductions in child poverty through this economic shock. We are building more houses than ever on a yearly basis and we have invested heavily in skills and training, with apprenticeships more than 50 percent higher than when we took office.“The result confirms that our strong health response during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks has also led to one of the best economic responses in the world.“In a volatile global environment it’s critical the fundamentals of the economy are strong, and they are. Our economic and fiscal position means we are well positioned to address ongoing challenges while continuing to make investments in the critical services New Zealanders need.“The Government’s strong finances allow us to focus on investing in what matters most to New Zealanders: growing wages and cost of living support, hospitals, schools, housing, and addressing climate change. The best investment in our economy is investing in our people.“However, the global environment is challenging and will continue to put significant pressure on the Government books, so we will keep running a tight ship in order to achieve a return to the surpluses our Government posted pre-COVID.“The end of the 2021/22 financial year marks the closing of the COVID Response and Recovery Fund and the end of emergency spending. As I have already indicated over the coming year with COVID cost pressures reduced we will look to cut our cloth and carefully target our spending as we have done over successive budgets to meet our priority investments.“Careful and balanced management will keep us on the pathway back to surplus. There is simply no room for unaffordable and untargeted tax cuts to those who need them the least. As we have seen, tax cuts with no plan for how to pay for them are economically reckless.“We have every reason to be feeling positive. Our borders are open, COVID restrictions are largely gone, and we are in a position to lock in the gains of near-record low unemployment, rising incomes and a larger economy than before COVID. We’re set to accelerate our progress this summer as tourists and international students return, and working holidaymakers and skilled migrants fill workforce gaps.“Despite the challenges the world throws at us, New Zealanders can be optimistic about our future. Our economy is doing better than predicted and with restrictions lifted we can seize the opportunities created by the Government’s strong COVID and fiscal management,” Grant Robertson said.Key resultsCore Crown revenue was 4.1 percent ahead of forecast at $117.5 billion, as the strong economic recovery boosted business results and led to more people in work, which contributed to higher tax revenue.Core Crown expenses were 2.2 percent below forecast at $125.6 billion, as our successful COVID response to the Delta and Omicron outbreaks meant allocated pandemic-related spending was not required in full. Some of these expenses, like ongoing investment in protections such as therapeutics and vaccines, will shift into the current fiscal year.Net debt ended the year at 17.2 percent of GDP, in line with Budget 2022 forecasts. This is one of the lowest levels in the OECD and well below the Government’s debt ceiling of 30 percent, ensuring we are well positioned to weather further economic shocks.On a comparative measure produced by the IMF, our debt position as a percentage of GDP is roughly half the level of Australia, a quarter of the UK, and a fifth of the US.Key fiscal indicators – 30 June 2022% GDP$ billionActualForecast Budget 22ActualForecast Budget 22OBEGAL-2.7%-5.2%-9.7-19.0Core Crown tax revenue30.2%28.6%108.5103.8Core Crown expenses35.0%35.4%125.6128.4excluding significant Covid expenses30.9%110.0Net debt17.2%16.9%61.961.2Net core Crown debt35.9%36.9%128.9133.6","Publication Date: 5 October 2022

Aotearoa New Zealand supports Tokelau response to COVID_19,"The Government has announced it is sending a shipment of medical supplies to Tokelau to help its response to the first cases of COVID-19 in quarantine.“Tokelau has done an outstanding job of building health resilience and keeping COVID-19 out of their nation so far. In preparation, around 96 percent of its population are vaccinated providing a strong defence against the virus,” Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said.“Aotearoa New Zealand has provided support to Tokelau since the outset of the pandemic, supporting preparedness through the provision of COVID-19 vaccines.“As they deal with their first cases, we are sending a shipment of further medical supplies including second booster vaccines, 11,900 RATs, PPE, and other essential equipment, alongside preparing to provide COVID-19 oral antivirals,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“The impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world, including in the Pacific. We know from our own experiences how challenging it is to deal with the virus,” Associate Foreign Minister Aupito William Sio said.“Aotearoa New Zealand is working closely with the Pasifika Medical Association to respond to any needs for additional primary health care doctors and nurses, and we have also offered surge laboratory personnel.“Tokelau's high vaccination rates,preparations and support from the Polynesian Health Corridors team, should give assurance that they can still look forward to enjoying Christmas with their families,“Aupito William Sio said.“These supplies are part of our ongoing commitment support Pacific partners as they combat COVID-19.

Working together on resilience and climate action in Niue,"Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta has wrapped up her first official visit to Niue, reaffirming Aotearoa New Zealand’s commitment to work together to strengthen resilience in the region and support climate action.During the visit, Nanaia Mahuta met Niue Premier Dalton Tagelagi and Cabinet, and was the first outside speaker to address a special session of the Niue Legislative Assembly, the Fale Fono II.“This visit has allowed New Zealand to emphasise the strength of our special constitutional relationship with Niue as we continue to collaborate on areas of shared interest to both our countries and the wider Pacific region,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“We know climate change is the number one challenge facing Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa — and our top priority moving forward. Premier Tagelagi and I discussed New Zealand’s climate finance contributions, and how to enable Niue to meet its climate change priorities.“We confirmed a further $500,000 investment from our 2022-2025 international climate finance commitment, to complete design and planning for Niue’s renewable energy projects. This builds on $5 million for solar generation from a previous climate package,announced by the Prime Ministerin 2018. Niue has a target of 80% renewable generation,” Nanaia Mahuta said.The Minister visited Niue High School where she opened refurbished buildings upgraded by the NZ Defence Force in July as part of Exercise Tropic Twilight. She also discussed new initiatives to support the preservation of Vagahau Niue and other Pacific languages through greater collaboration, and sharing of teaching and learning resources.“Investing in the preservation and resilience of Vagahau Niue and other Pacific languages is a priority for New Zealand and our Pacific Peoples Minister. Our commitment reflects support for intergenerational and cultural resilience in the Pacific,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“The whakapapa connections of te reo Māori and the languages of Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, including Vagahau Niue, provides a basis for a rich and productive partnership,” Nanaia Mahuta said.The Minister also met with Niue’s health workers and the Niue COVID-19 Committee to commend their efforts at keeping the community safe during the pandemic. New Zealand and Niue worked closely on theCOVID-19 pandemic response, including the provision of vaccines andsurge personnelto support clinical and public health teams.The Minister departed Niue for Tonga this morning.","Publication Date: 18 August 2022

New Zealand_s support for Fiji_s COVID_19 response continues with vaccine delivery_ operational support,"Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta has announced further support for Fiji, including funding support for nursing staff and 100,000 doses of vaccines due to arrive in country today.“Our thoughts remain with Fiji during this incredibly challenging period,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“New Zealand has funded 100,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine directly from the Spanish government in order to meet Fiji’s immediate vaccine requirements. The vaccines will arrive in Fiji later today.“AstraZeneca is Fiji’s vaccine of choice and these doses will further support the excellent work Fiji is doing in vaccinating its population.”“Earlier this year New Zealand committed to providing up to 500,000 doses of vaccine to support Fiji’s rollout. Fiji’s vaccination programme is progressing well with 25% now fully vaccinated, and first doses provided to 82% of the population. Our commitment stands and New Zealand will continue to work with Fiji to confirm its remaining vaccine requirements,” said Nanaia Mahuta.New Zealand is also funding the recruitment of 190 Fiji graduate nurses, for a three month period, to provide surge capacity across the health system including at Fiji’s isolation facilities.“The recruitment of these nurses not only supports Fiji’s response in the short term, but also contributes to the long-term resilience of the health sector,” Nanaia Mahuta said.Aotearoa has also responded to a range of other requests from the Fiji Government and civil society.“In the last two weeks New Zealand has supported the provision and retrofitting of ambulances and medical equipment, provided funding support to civil society partners and begun delivering 700,000 testing swabs and privacy screens for medical facilities,” said Nanaia Mahuta.These initiatives build on previous packages of support New Zealand has provided Fiji to enable its COVID-19 response, including $40 million of financial assistance, PPE, testing equipment and other relief supplies. New Zealand has also deployed two rotations of medical personnel to the joint Australia New Zealand Medical Assistance Team providing surge clinical, logistical and public health support for the Fiji health system.“We remain in close contact with the Government of Fiji and civil society partners to support further requests,” Nanaia Mahuta said.ENDS","Publication Date: 3 August 2021

Prime Minister to chair APEC Leaders Meeting,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has today marked the beginning of the fully virtual APEC 2021 Leaders Week, where political, business and young leaders come together for a series of events that conclude New Zealand’s host year.The Prime Minister will conclude the week by chairing the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting where the 21 Leaders will gather virtually to discuss the ongoing management of COVID-19 and further regional trade and economic cooperation between member economies.“Having convened APEC Leaders for an additional COVID-19 summit in July, this meeting will focus on charting a path to recovery out of this once-in-a-century crisis,” Jacinda Ardern said.“APEC’s focus remains on the regional response and recovery from COVID-19. Together we are continuing to keep supply chains functioning and are supporting trade in critical medical supplies – including testing kits, PPE and now vaccines.“Through APEC Leaders we will build on the progress so far by energising the region’s economic recovery, taking action to decarbonise our economies, and promoting growth that leaves no one behind,” Jacinda Ardern said.Through New Zealand’s hosting year, APEC economies have:agreed to help speed up the flow of vaccines and related goods across borders and reduced their costs;agreed a five year programme of work on economic reforms that will kick start growth, create new jobs and help combat climate change;laid the groundwork for a voluntary standstill on fossil fuel subsides – hundreds of billions of dollars are spent every year on subsidising fuels that harm our environment;agreed to lock in digital and paperless customs procedures, saving business significant time and cost by removing requirements for physical paperwork; andset a new roadmap to guide efforts to boost food security over the next ten years.“If there is one thing that we can be certain of right now, it is that no economy can overcome this pandemic alone, it will require all of our continued cooperation to secure a successful regional recovery for all,” Jacinda Ardern said.“We are not just focused on the here and now – but also focused on providing strong direction to APEC’s work through to 2040 as we strive to reignite growth and respond to the challenges of the pandemic,” Jacinda Ardern said.The APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting will conclude a busy five days during which New Zealand political, business and young leaders welcome Asia-Pacific counterparts for a series of events that conclude New Zealand’s APEC’s host year. These are:The Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and Trade & Export Growth will host regional counterparts at the APEC Ministerial Meeting on 9 and 10 November.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will open the APEC CEO Summit on 11 and 12 November which brings together Presidents, Prime Ministers, Chief Executives, entrepreneurs and thought-leaders to exchange perspectives on the big issues facing the Asia-Pacific.Young people will meet at the Voices of the Future Conference on 9 and 10 November, where Prime Minister Ardern will deliver a keynote speech.Leaders will have their annual dialogue with the APEC Business Advisory Council on 12 November. Co-chaired by Prime Minister Ardern and Rachel Taulelei, the 2021 Chair of the APEC Business Advisory Council.Chaired by Prime Minister Ardern, the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting will be held overnight on 12-13 November.Between the Prime Minister and APEC Ministers, bilateral meetings have been held with all APEC economies across the 2021 host year – highlighting how chairing APEC has opened doors for New Zealand.","Publication Date: 8 November 2021

Second COVID_19 vaccine receives provisional approval,"New Zealand’s regulatory authority Medsafe has granted provisional approval of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 18 years of age and older, COVID-19 Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.“New Zealand secured 2 million doses of the Janssen vaccine through an advance purchase agreement last year. We purchased a portfolio of vaccine options to provide us with flexibility, and the approval of a second COVID-19 vaccine is welcome news.“Medsafe follows a rigorous assessment process informed by the most up to date medical and scientific data. Approval has been very carefully considered with safety the key priority.“The medical evidence shows Janssen is a very safe and effective vaccine. It is a great addition to our vaccine options,” Chris Hipkins said.The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has also received emergency or provisional approval in Canada, USA and Australia.“While our plan remains to ramp up the roll-out using the Pfizer vaccine from here, having the option of the Janssen vaccine increases our choices and provides us with flexibility if we need it. As a single dose vaccine, it may be useful in hard to reach locations or emergencies, or for those who cannot get the Pfizer vaccine.”New Zealand is already receiving significant deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine and has secured enough doses of the Pfizer vaccine for the population of New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours, in 2021.“Provisional approval is the first step in the process. Cabinet will weigh up the options on the best use of the Janssen vaccine following advice from officials. A Cabinet ‘decision to use’ can be expected sometime in August,” Chris Hipkins said.“Our roll out of the COVID-19 immunisation programme is well under way and we have a plan to offer a Pfizer vaccine to everyone in New Zealand by the end of the year.“It’s good to have a range of options to access safe and effective vaccines to meet the need of New Zealanders now and in the future.”","Publication Date: 7 July 2021

NZ ready to provide _75m for Pacific and global COVID_19 vaccination support,"New Zealand is preparing to support our Pacific partners to access safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines at the earliest opportunity, Foreign Affairs Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta and Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Aupito William Sio say.“Pacific countries have worked hard to keep COVID-19 out, or to stamp it out, and New Zealand has been committed to supporting them in this,” Nanaia Mahuta said. “But their success has been hard-won. A safe and effective vaccine will be key to the region’s economic and social recovery.”Nanaia Mahuta confirmed $75 million of Official Development Assistance had been earmarked to support Pacific and global vaccine access and roll-out.“New Zealand is pursuing a portfolio of potential COVID-19 vaccines to ensure we have flexibility and choice in the fast-moving global marketplace. We want to make sure Pacific countries can also access suitable options, and have the support they need to run successful immunisation campaigns.”Aupito William Sio said New Zealand’s support has to be flexible, given the uncertainties around vaccine development.New Zealand’s approach will be to purchase sufficient vaccines to cover the Realm of New Zealand (Tokelau, Niue, Cook Islands) and our Polynesian neighbours (Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu) should their governments wish to take these up.“We are best placed to support these countries directly because of our constitutional relationships in the Realm, and the strong links between our health systems and our close people-to-people ties across Polynesia,” Aupito William Sio said. “We will also be scaling up existing health investments to enable us to play our part in vaccine roll-out.Included in the $75m support package, New Zealand plans to make a further $10m contribution to the COVAX Facility Advance Market Commitment, which is the key multilateral mechanism that has emerged to support equitable global access. New Zealand is also ready to contribute to wider Pacific regional initiatives as they take shape.","Publication Date: 17 December 2020

Prime Minister_s Speech to NZIIA Annual Conference,"Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, ata mārie, tēnā koutou katoa.It’s a great pleasure to attend an event on such an important topic as New Zealand’s future in the Indo-Pacific region.Thank you to the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs for bringing this hui together.I am encouraged to see so many young New Zealanders present.But I’m also not surprised. As a high school student, I was fascinated by global politics. And at university, it wasn’t domestic politics I primarily studied – it was international relations.In fact, I am not sure I have shared this with MFAT before, but as a student at Waikato University I recall one day seeing a flyer advertising the fact that representatives from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be on campus as part of their graduate recruitment programme. I took down the details and when the day arrived, I joined literally hundreds of others as we piled into a fairly packed lecture theatre to hear about what it took to be a diplomat.This was some years ago, but while I can’t recall all that was said, I do recall two very important words – double degree. I walked out of there and decided that the entry criteria were a little too high for me. Apparently, I didn’t apply that same logic for any of the roles I have taken on since.Over the years it has struck me though, how interested not just our young people, but our nation is in the politics and decision making of others.  It is easy to assume that all countries would take the level of interest we do in global affairs – but I can tell you that in my experience, they don’t. How many other countries would for instance, factor in the timing of another country’s election in relation to our own? I am still convinced that the last two American elections have probably captured people’s attention to the same degree, if not more, than our own have.I can think of two reasons why this level of global interest persists in New Zealand. The first is size. We have an acute sense of our place in the world. But the second, is that we have all too often experienced the impact of others’ decisions on us; the testing of nuclear weapons, dramatic changes in economic policy, war.We may be far from others, but we are not, and have never been, isolated from the impacts of global politics.  And you can see this acute sense of self and others in the fundamentals of New Zealand’s foreign policy.Many of our current settings were established by Prime Minister Fraser, who was instrumental in establishing the United Nations under some of the most challenging international conditions imaginable.Peter Fraser recognised for instance that a lasting peace depended on a successful United Nations that collectively protected the sovereignty and independence of small countries.Those fundamentals remain, and they have been further reinforced by successive global challenges.We have entered an era of formidable environmental, health, and geopolitical difficulties. And in this era, each nation is faced with choices. We either ignore the impact our domestic decisions have on others and choose a path of isolationism and nationalism, or we take the view that concerted collective action is the necessary response.Here in Aotearoa New Zealand, the environment in which we are making our foreign policy decisions has changed, but the values we use to make those decisions have not.I want to spend a bit of time today talking about that environment and how we steady our ship in what often feels like ever turbulent seas, with a particular focus on your area of interest – the Indo-Pacific.To start- I have a question for you. Where do you see our place in the world?If you were to ask me, I would give you a very literal answer. The Pacific. This is our home. It is the region we most squarely identify with. We very literally share a population base.That’s why, when we came into office, we focused immediately on lifting New Zealand’s engagement with the Pacific region, delivering greater investment and building long term partnerships. Looking forward, we are focused on long-term resilience, with a high degree of Pacific ownership and innovation.But the Pacific itself is an increasingly contested region.And so, to understand that complexity, and respond to it, we also see the Indo-Pacific as central to our interests.We have embraced the concept of an Indo-Pacific as the wider home for New Zealand, locating Aotearoa in a larger ecosystem of nations and regions that includes East Asia, the Pacific, the Indian sub-continent and the Pacific Rim.Māori tūpuna (ancestors) voyaged through the region.  More recent waves of migration have further entrenched this connection.It is a region where the rules-based international order has already supported huge improvements in human conditions, but is a region of deep diversity.The Indo-Pacific includes highly advanced economies Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and United States and Canada.China remains an engine of global growth and one of our most significant, but also one of our increasingly complex relationshipsAustralia – New Zealand’s indispensable partner and ally with a strong track record of contributing in the region – sits at the intersection of both the Indian and Pacific oceans.The rapidly growing and demographically young countries of ASEAN have 650 million people and a rapidly expanding middle class.With all of this regional diversity, New Zealand is not alone in adopting an Indo-Pacific outlook.The ten countries of ASEAN plus Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Germany have also referred to an Indo-Pacific region in reaction to more challenging geopolitics.But while we welcome the concept of an Indo-Pacific region, we do so based on the principles that have served New Zealand well and are consistent with our values.From New Zealand’s perspective, these fundamental principles include:•    Respect for rules: consistency with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation and overflight•    Openness: that the region is open for trade, investment, and the movement of people to support prosperity and open supply chains•    Inclusivity: that all countries in  the region can participate•    That sovereignty is upheld and respected•    Transparency: that states are honest about their foreign policy objectives and initiatives beyond their bordersIn our view, the Indo-Pacific region will need to conduct its affairs in accordance with these principles if it is to successfully address common challenges.Here, the principles of openness and inclusivity are especially key for New Zealand. Often language and geographic ‘frames’ are used as subtext, or a tool to exclude some nations from dialogue. Our success will depend on working with the widest possible set of partners.And so, as a region, what are the challenges that lie ahead of us, and how can we use these principles that are core to New Zealand’s foreign policy approach to resolve them?The natural place to start is COVID.New Zealand has been pleased to contribute to other countries’ COVID-19 responses, with an emphasis on the Pacific.That parts of the Pacific remain COVID-free has been an achievement. But economic impacts have been severe, nonetheless.Vaccines are a critical tool needed by every government to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on their people and economy. As has been said many times – we will not be safe, till we are all safe. A singular focus on vaccinating our own populations with little regard to others is a recipe for variants, and for possibly undermining the very vaccines we are working so hard to provide.That’s one of the reasons we are working with our partners to support vaccine roll-outs to our Pacific neighbours, and others.The COVAX Facility has commenced deliveries of our donation of 1.66 million doses.Our contribution to COVAX of $17 million also means we are also supporting vaccination in the broader Indo-Pacific region and beyond.But more is required. Equitable access to vaccines for all countries requires global support. The COVAX Facility needs funding and donation of vaccine doses.New Zealand has been an early mover and I welcome recent donations from others, including the G7’s commitment to provide 1 billion doses.Early in the pandemic we moved swiftly to support the Ejikman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta to help ensure Indonesia had the testing capability it needed to understand how the virus was spreading.When the pandemic intensified in Nepal, New Zealand moved quickly to release $1 million for UNICEF to support children and their families.In Viet Nam, both suffering from the economic shock from COVID and the collapse of tourism – our overseas development team pivoted to support training for women workers from the informal sector so they could support themselves and their families.In Timor-Leste the Royal New Zealand Air Force flew in much needed supplies of PPE as COVID started to break out.There are hundreds of similar stories from across our network of Embassies and High Commissions, where New Zealand has stepped up  to support the local COVID response.But now is the time to turn our individual action, into collective momentum.  That includes in our role as chair of APEC.There are over 100,000 new cases of COVID-19 in the APEC region every single day.  And more than 80 million people lost their jobs across our economies last year, during the biggest economic contraction since the Second World War.On Friday night I will chair the first ever extraordinary meeting of APEC Leaders.  This will be a unique opportunity to bring APEC Leaders together to discuss how to get the region through the health crisis and accelerate economic recovery in a way that lays the foundations for a better future.That better future, must surely include better levels of preparedness for the risks we all face. That’s a challenge that extends beyond just APEC.It is clear our global community was not adequately prepared for COVID-19. It is also clear that COVID-19 will not be the last global health risk that we face.I want to put on record again, New Zealand’s support for the ambitious and practical recommendations set out by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, co-chaired by Helen Clark.In keeping with our strong multilateral approach to global challenges, it is our intention to not just passively support these recommendations, but to actively engage on work-streams to develop a new pandemic Treaty; to improve global surveillance, validation and early response; and to strengthen the World Health Organisation. We see these areas of work as critical to our collective health and wellbeing, and a new frontier in which we believe New Zealand has a role to play alongside others.But COVID 19 has exposed other frailties we have all long been familiar with.As a trading nation, New Zealand has also focused on keeping markets and supply chains open during the pandemic, when for some governments there has been a temptation to turn inwards.Working with partners like Australia and Singapore, and through APEC, New Zealand has led political efforts to support regional supply chains and free trade in essential goods and medicines.New Zealand is focused on protecting the multilateral trading system at a time when it is under stress. This means working to ensure that the World Trade Organisation remains well-functioning.New Zealand has also maintained momentum in our trade negotiations, concluding the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the China FTA upgrade.And we continue to progress a full negotiating agenda, with the European Union and United Kingdom negotiations well-advanced, and an upgrade of our FTA with ASEAN under way.New Zealand actively encourages other economies to join the economic agreements we have initiated – including countries from outside the region.Last month we joined consensus on the formation of a working group to negotiate the UK’s accession to CPTPP. Other economies will be able to join CPTPP too.CPTPP is our highest quality agreement.  Those aspiring to join will have to be able to meet its high standards.But before I roam too widely from a discussion on regional architecture, it would be remiss of me not to mention the importance of ASEAN.ASEAN is a source of economic opportunity and diversified trading relationships. Our dialogue partner status with ASEAN has enabled some of our most important free trade agreements. And people from South East Asia have contributed richly to New Zealand.Our relationship with ASEAN gives New Zealand a seat at the region’s top table for strategic discussions – the East Asia Summit, and is the convening body for regional diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific.And the proof is in the pudding. ASEAN has helped keep members at peace with one another since the end of the Vietnam War.Our partnership with ASEAN is also a case where New Zealand can pursue cooperation that is principled and pragmatic. The trajectory of political development in South East Asia is uneven, with democracy in retreat in some places and grave human rights abuses occurring around the region.We are concerned for instance by the trampling of democracy by Myanmar’s military – the Tatmadaw.  We have expressed our condemnation of the coup and have taken steps to pressure Tatmadaw leaders towards the return to civilian government.New Zealand sees it as critical that the regime releases those people arbitrarily detained since the coup, including foreign nationals and political prisoners.We also have serious concerns over the situation in the South China Sea, including artificial island building, continued militarisation, and activities which pose risks to freedom of navigation and overflight.Climate change is a grave threat to low lying South East Asian countries as well as to Pacific Island states.The majority of global carbon dioxide emissions come from the Indo-Pacific region.Here, we have a role to play in ensuring our regional architecture is up to the challenge.Trade can be a key part of the climate solution, by removing barriers for environmentally-beneficial goods and services, and eliminating government subsidisation of fossil fuels.APEC trade ministers have agreed to consider options for ending new subsidies on fossil fuels.And New Zealand is leading negotiations of the first-of-its-kind trade agreement - the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability.But it continues to be the case that New Zealand can best give effect to our foreign policy in partnership with others. Our independent foreign policy has never meant that we pursue our objectives on our own. We will increasingly prioritise and progress our interests through multilateral mechanisms but also through regional partnership.I understand that later this morning, White House Asia Coordinator Kurt Campbell, who knows our region well, will address this meeting.We look forward to working with the Biden Administration on regional issues.  New Zealand’s relationship with the United States has deep roots, built over many decades of cooperation. We share values and have common interests in how the region operates.To conclude, the Indo-Pacific is to some degree at an inflection point.The forms of cooperation needed to overcome COVID-19 require countries to let go of narrow nationalistic approaches. A full economic recovery can only come after other countries vaccinate their populations and suppress the virus’ transmission.The post-Covid world will be a new era.Our goal has to be to make it a better era, and if the Indo-Pacific is to successfully rise to the many challenges it faces, governments will need to re-commit to supporting an open and rules-based regional order; one that’s more sustainable and resilient.And we must recommit to doing what we can, to encourage that change.We will do so in ways that are pragmatic, that advance our interests, and that are consistent with New Zealand’s values.We will do so in a variety of formats – through private diplomacy or through public statements on our terms, sometimes speaking out alone – at other times in concert with governments who share our concerns.An independent, principled foreign policy is a powerfully simple concept.As Norman Kirk described it, “we want New Zealand’s foreign policy to express New Zealand’s ideals as well as reflect our national interests”.That means that while New Zealand must work with the region as it is, we are also clear on what we stand for: the rule of law, human dignity, and universal human rights.And that’s why we will encourage partners to continue on the pathway of democratic reform – just as New Zealand continues to improve its own political system – to protect the institutional enablers of democracy: free and fair elections, an independent judiciary, a free press, and freedom of assembly and association.New Zealand ultimately aspires for the Indo-Pacific region to become freer and more open. As the region emerges from the pandemic, we hope it will be both.","Publication Date: 14 July 2021

Govt_s careful economic management recognised,"The Government’s prudent fiscal management and strong policy programme in the face of the COVID-19 global pandemic have been acknowledged by the credit rating agency Fitch.Fitch hastodayaffirmed New Zealand’s local currency rating at AA+ with a stable outlook and foreign currency rating at AA with a positive outlook.The agency praised the Government’s policy framework, saying the robust public health and macro-policy response to the global COVID-19 pandemic has enabled New Zealand to weather the economic shock exceptionally well by global standards.“This is further confirmation that our decision to move quickly to protect our people and our economy was the right one, as COVID-19 took hold overseas. We used our strong balance sheet to support our workers and businesses through lockdowns as well as keeping in place a buffer in the case of a resurgence,” Grant Robertson said.Fitch also noted the Government’s effective suppression of COVID-19 domestically and its policy response has meant New Zealand is in a V-shaped economic recovery, with GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels by the September quarter last year.“The economic bounce back was a result of our decision to act swiftly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We supported 1.8 million workers through the Wage Subsidy Scheme and invested billions in infrastructure, training and creating jobs,” Grant Robertson said.“While there are vaccines being rolled out in countries seriously affected by COVID-19, the world is by no means out of the woods yet. There is still a huge amount of global uncertainty in the face of new strains of the virus and continued struggles in many countries to contain COVID-19 domestically.“We went into the economic shock caused by the global pandemic with our finances in good shape, including with very low public debt. While we have borrowed more to protect our people and economy, our net debt as a percentage of GDP remains lower than many of our international peers,” Grant Robertson said.","Publication Date: 13 January 2021

_23_5m to support community_led Māori vaccination campaigns,"The Government has approved $23.5 million for eight Māori organisations and iwi aimed at boosting Māori vaccination rates, through the new $120 million Māori Communities COVID-19 Fund.Today’s funding announcement is part of the first phase $60 millionfocused on vaccination rates and a further $60 million will support Māori and iwi-led initiatives to protect their communities against COVID-19.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Māori Crown Relations Minister Kelvin Davis are in Te Tai Tokerau today seeing first-hand some of the successful vaccination initiatives being rolled out in Māori communities.“We know that local solutions are how we are going to reach the rest of Maori with our vaccination message,” Kelvin Davis said.“There are an army of volunteers, iwi and Māori organisations already working hard on this mahi and with the funding provided their efforts will be supercharged.”The Māori Communities COVID-19 Fund was announced just over a week ago.Minister for Māori Development Willie Jackson, on behalf of the Ministerial Oversight Group reviewing funding proposals, said the quality of the proposals supported the swift decision-making needed to accelerate vaccination rates for Māori.“The task now is to put our foot on the pedal and reach Māori, particularly in high priority and low vaccination areas like Te Tai Tokerau, Counties Manukau, Lakes District, Taranaki and Tairāwhiti DHBs,” Willie Jackson said.Associate Health Minister Peeni Henare said it was community mobilisation that was making all the difference.“Māori passed 70% having their first jab last Friday. I want to mihi all the hard-working Māori providers, iwi and community groups who, with DHBs, supported whānau to reach that milestone,” Peeni Henare said.Te Puni Kōkiri and Te Arawhiti will now work through funding contracts with the successful Māori organisations and iwi.The first of the Phase One funding round proposals include:Te Tai Tokerau ($4.6 million):includes support for iwi and marae communities, mobile vaccination clinics, events for rangatahi, and targeted communications and 0800 call centre.  This includes priority areas such as Kaikohe, Otangarei, Raumanga and Kaitāia East and West.Tāmaki Makaurau ($1.8 million):includes funding for mobile vaccination clinics, wānanga, clinical staffing and health promotion resources. Priority groups include rangatahi, hard to reach whānau who are vaccine-hesitant, kura kaupapa and bilingual schools.Waikato-Waiariki ($4.95 million):funding to reach isolated whānau and communities including transport for mobile vaccination clinics, clinical staff and wrap-around support, addressing vaccine hesitation, and community outreach and events.North Island – ($5 million):extension of existing funding for the Whanāu Ora Commissioning Agency including vaccination programme, providing vaccine delivery and pastoral support across more than 80 Whānau Ora providers. Also, incentives and activities (e.g. kai, petrol vouchers and essentials) for rangatahi, whānau and Māori communities to encourage vaccination.Taranaki ($1.3 million):includes funding for eight iwi in Taranaki to increase trained vaccinators, recruit nurses, and kaiārahi to set upHeretaunga ($2.2 million):building on successful vaccine mobilisation and events to address accessibility issues, facing Māori in the rohe; transport, mobile vaccine clinics, community champions, events and incentives, particularly targeting rangatahi as 50% of the rohe Māori population is 10-29 years.Whanganui ($2.8 million):funding for iwi covering Southern Taranaki, Rangitīkei and Ruapehu district for community resilience and vaccination response including:  digital data capture of Māori vaccination rates; mobile outreach and vaccine incentives and events and communication of information and community engagement to reduce misinformation.Te Waipounamu ($0.7 million):funding to accelerate Māori vaccinations and build on the previous work of Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu Whānau Ora agency including:  vaccination clinics, events, mobile outreach, food distribution, communication and removing barriers to vaccination.  All of South Island and targeted initiatives to Invercargill, Alexandra, Ōtautahi and Te Tai Poutini.The Māori Communities COVID-19 Fund involves a two-phase approach focused on further mobilising local vaccination initiatives for whānau, and on supporting Māori, iwi and communities to prepare for the new protection framework.Further proposals for the $60m Phase One initiative, focused on vaccination, will be considered by the Ministerial Oversight Group this week.","Publication Date: 2 November 2021

First batch of COVID_19 vaccine arrives in NZ,"The first batch of COVID-19 vaccine arrived in New Zealand this morning, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed.The shipment of around 60,000 doses arrived as airfreight at Auckland International Airport at 9.34am today.“The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine’s arrival allows us to start New Zealand’s largest-ever immunisation programme,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Between now and when the vaccination programme starts, quality assurance, and checks by Medsafe and the pharmaceutical company will be undertaken.“We expect to start vaccinating border and MIQ workers in Auckland this Saturday. The more than 30,000 courses will be more than enough to vaccinate this group of workers over the coming 2-3 weeks.“Our border workforce such as cleaners, the nurses who undertake health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, airline staff and hotel workers have worked tirelessly to keep all New Zealanders safe and will rightly be first to receive the vaccine.“We know they’re most at-risk of coming into contact with the virus and that’s why we’re targeting them first, as it will also help prevent COVID-19 entering our communities,” Jacinda Ardern said.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said that since arriving this morning, the shipment has had further checks to confirm it has arrived safely and intact, and has been kept at the correct temperature during its flight here - it must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius.“This has been completed and the vaccine has been formally transferred to our ownership and has been transferred to our new ultra-low temperature storage facility in Auckland,” Chris Hipkins said.“We’re expecting further shipments of vaccine over coming weeks and will receive about 225,000 vaccine courses by the end of March.“As these batches arrive, we’ll vaccinate border workers’ household contacts, then the next group will be many frontline healthcare and essential workers, plus those most at risk from COVID-19, such as older people or those with medical conditions that make them vulnerable if infected.“This is another important step in the roll out of New Zealand’s vaccination programme and our efforts to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 15 February 2021

Vaccination_ isolation and masks remain key to public safety this winter,"Being up to date with vaccinations, staying home if unwell and wearing masks in healthcare settings remains key to minimising the impact of COVID-19 and reducing pressure on our health system over winter, Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall said today.Cabinet has agreed to retain mandatory measures for cases to isolate for 7 days and retain the mandatory use of masks for visitors to health care settings.However Cabinet has asked for more work to be done on whether testing to return to work earlier than the 7 days for people who are not symptomatic or are mild cases could be a safe and effective model to reduce the impact on workforce this winter.“We know isolation for COVID-19 cases is the best way to break the chain of transmission to make sure people aren’t passing on the virus and getting other people sick,” Minister Verrall said.“Isolation remains effective in managing spread and keeping case numbers down, and it also helps reduce pressure on our hospital services.“But we need to make sure our settings are right, and look at examples of what is working around the world. A test to return to work rule for lower risk or mild or asymptomatic cases could help reduce the strain on some workforces this winter.“Cabinet will consider advice on this within the next two months.“Wearing face masks in healthcare settings remain an important tool to reduce your own risk and also the risk for others, especially those more vulnerable or susceptible to the virus. These settings will remain for now.“I also urge those eligible for the new COVID-19 bivalent vaccine to get themselves vaccinated, and boosted when eligible,” Minister Verrall said.Cabinet has agreed today to remove the legal framework around the Point of Care Tests Order, which regulates the importation, manufacture, sale and use of tests such as rapid antigen tests (RATs).This Order was originally enacted under the elimination strategy when there was no access to approved self-tests and is no longer necessary.","Publication Date: 11 April 2023

New COVID_19 Protection Framework delivers greater freedoms for vaccinated New Zealanders,"New COVID-19 Protection Framework provides pathway out of lockdown and ability for businesses and events to re-open to vaccinated New ZealandersSimpler framework to minimise cases and hospitalisations without use of widespread lockdownsAuckland to move into the new framework when 90 percent of eligible population in each of the three DHBs are fully vaccinated90 percent fully vaccinated target set across each DHB region before rest of the country moves into new systemUp to $940 million per fortnight in Business Boost package$120 million to accelerate Māori vaccination ratesCabinet to review vaccination progress on November 29Vaccinated New Zealanders will regain everyday freedoms when the country moves to a new simplified COVID-19 Protection Framework that doesn’t rely on nationwide lockdowns as the main measure to stop the virus spreading.In a suite of announcements that establish a pathway out of restrictions the Government is also providing up to $940 million per fortnight to support businesses through the challenging period, particularly those in Auckland. $120 million is also being provided to accelerate Māori vaccination rates in the coming weeks.“Our current alert level framework and elimination strategy kept us safe and the economy functioning while we vaccinated but now as more Kiwis are protected by the vaccine we need a new plan to that moves away from lockdowns as our primary defence against the virus,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.“The new COVID-19 Protection Framework sets a pathway forward that rewards the rapidly growing number of vaccinated New Zealanders with more freedoms to go about their lives safely.“The simplified framework has three levels: green, orange and red. Vaccine certificates will provide greater freedoms at each level, and there will be extra public health precautions built in at higher levels to minimise the impact of COVID-19 and suppress the spread of the virus,” Jacinda Ardern said.The new traffic light framework will allow businesses previously considered high-risk to fully open to vaccinated customers at green and orange and continue to operate with some restrictions at red. Businesses that choose to open to the unvaccinated will face restrictions in order to suppress the virus amongst those most likely to have it.“Fully vaccinated people will be able to reconnect with family and friends, go to bars and restaurants and do the things they love with greater certainty and confidence. The framework also provides businesses greater certainty to plan and grow,” Jacinda Ardern said.“If you are still unvaccinated, not only will you be more at risk of catching COVID-19, but many of the freedoms others enjoy will be out of reach. No-one wants that to happen but we need to minimise the threat of the virus, which is now mainly spreading amongst unvaccinated people.“These new requirements are a strong incentive for those who still haven’t had their first dose to do so quickly. The choice is clear for anyone who wants to go to a bar, restaurant, gym or to attend gatherings.“The framework maintains the ability to move up levels when needed to control an outbreak, but is more flexible than the current alert level system.“That is because there is clear evidence the virus finds it harder to spread in vaccinated environments which is why businesses that provide services only to vaccinated people can operate at every level of the new framework and without any restrictions at green and orange.“Testing, contact tracing and isolation will continue as key tools to minimise any spread of the virus. And localised lockdowns will still be an option if we see a rapid growth in cases in areas with high levels of unvaccinated people.“A target of 90 percent fully vaccinated across each DHB region has been set as the milestone to trigger moving the country into the new system. This target ensures good regional spread across the country and will also help address equity issues within each region.“Modelling shows having 90 percent of eligible people fully vaccinated provides a high level of coverage, keeping most New Zealanders safe and helping slow and control outbreaks, assisting public health authorities to do their job.“Auckland will be able to move sooner. This plan provides a clear path for Auckland to move out of lockdown as soon as 90 percent fully vaccinated is reached in each of the city’s three DHBs.“Ultimately we have balanced the desire to re-open quickly while continuing to keep people safe. This plan is unique to New Zealand and rewards New Zealanders who have chosen to be vaccinated, while also giving us the flexibility to step up our response if needed.“High vaccination rates is also an important step to allow us to reconnect New Zealanders to the world.“As we move through the most challenging part of the vaccination campaign this is the clearest incentive we can offer to people to get vaccinated. If you want to do the things you love then you need to get vaccinated.“If you haven’t booked a first dose – do it today. It’s how we win our freedoms and do the things we love doing. It’s our ticket to summer,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 22 October 2021

Government confirms COVID_19 vaccinations to protect tamariki,"Parents and caregivers will have the opportunity to protect their children aged 5 to 11 against COVID-19 with the child version of the Pfizer vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today.“A key focus of the Government is to keep everyone in New Zealand safe from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Chris Hipkins said.“That’s why Cabinet has agreed with the advice from the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group, off the back of Medsafe approval that confirms both the safety and efficacy of the paediatric vaccine, to use of the vaccine to protect 5 to 11-years-olds.“This will happen from 17 January. There are 476,000 children between ages 5-11 who will become eligible to get their first dose from this date, and their second dose at least eight weeks later.“As we have seen to date, the virus can be unpredictable. While COVID-19 generally has milder effects in children, with symptoms similar to a cold, some children become severely ill and require hospitalisation.“In the most recent outbreak, 24% of cases have been aged 11 or under.“Like we have seen with adults, if your child is infected with COVID-19 they may transmit the virus to other people. Immunising 5 to 11-year-olds helps protect whānau members whose health makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19.”The Ministry of Health is working with iwi, DHBs, hauora providers, and community organisations to roll out the Pfizer vaccine to children in ways that suit whānau and communities.While there are no plans for a school-based immunisation programme, schools are being considered as community vaccination sites. This will add capacity to the vaccination network and make it even easier for families to get vaccinated.“The government is strongly encouraging parents to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19, but I want to be clear that this is a choice for parents. The Government has no intention of making COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for anyone in this age group,” Chris Hipkins said.“I encourage parents to make an informed choice and have their children vaccinated to protect them and those they love.""Notes for editors:Children need two doses of the vaccine to be fully protected. It is recommended that these are given at least 8 weeks apart, however the interval can be safely shortened to a minimum of 21 days if needed, for example if your child is starting significant immunosuppression treatment.The vaccine is free. A parent, caregiver or legal guardian will need to accompany your child to their appointment(s) as the responsible adult and provide consent for them to be vaccinated.The vaccine has been through clinical trials in children of the same age group. In general, the side effects that were reported were mild, didn’t last long, and were similar to side effects from other routine vaccines.Myocarditis and pericarditis are very rare but serious side effects of the Pfizer vaccine. In the clinical trial no cases were seen in children aged 5 to 11 however it is important to be aware of the symptoms for all ages who are vaccinated. The Covid-19 Vaccination Technical Advisory Group (CV-TAG) and Medsafe will continue to monitor safety data, including for these rare side effects, from the rollout of programmes to 5 to 11 year old children in other countries.Parents or caregivers can go to a walk-in clinic with their tamariki or use BookMyVaccine.nz to get immunised with their usual health provider, hauora, or general practice (make sure you select the appropriate age range).If you want to book for more than one child or you’re unable to book online, you can call the COVID Vaccination Healthline on 0800 28 29 26 (8am to 8pm, 7 days a week).The disability team is available Monday to Friday, from 8am to 8pm.

Funding boost supports ongoing Māori COVID_19 response,"The Government is responding to the need by whānau Māori and Māori Health providers to support their ongoing work responding to COVID-19 and to continue increasing rates of Māori vaccination, Associate Minister for Health (Māori Health), Peeni Henare and Minister for Māori Development Willie Jackson announced today.This increased funding of $38 million will ensure Māori health providers provide ongoing support to Māori communities while responding to COVID-19. It comes after engagement with the Māori health and disability sector, which showed providers are struggling to support the COVID-19 response within their current resources.“Māori are one of the most at-risk communities for COVID-19 and vaccination rates for Māori are behind the general population. However Māori health providers are well connected to their communities and have demonstrated their ability to protect whānau and get them vaccinated so we are increasing their support so they can keep doing that work without having to pull back,” Peeni Henare said.“It’s critical we put further resource into our Māori health providers at this time, especially with the increased risk posed by Delta and the current push to increase Māori vaccination rates.“There is clear evidence that Māori health providers are making inroads into our hard to reach communities and those who may be vaccine hesitant. It’s important they can continue this work with the funding and resources they need,” Peeni Henare said.Out of the total fund, $17 million will go to providers to help them adapt their current services to support the response, whilst also maintaining other essential services.“Our Māori health providers have told us they’re under immense pressure with increased demand to support testing, contact tracing, case management, and vaccinations, while also trying to keep up with their other work.“This funding ensures our providers can continue to support their communities without burning out or losing capacity,” Peeni Henare said.“$14 million of this funding will ensure whānau, especially those living in hard-to-reach areas, are able to access testing, vaccinations, medications, and other essential health services.“As well as taking care of their physical needs, it’s also important whānau are able to access mental health and wellbeing support. So, a further $3 million will be invested in a multi-media campaign and community programmes,” Peeni Henare said.A portion of this funding has also been allocated to directly support whānau, many of whom have been put under considerable stress through this recent outbreak.“An additional $2 million will ensure providers can work through the long tail of this current outbreak and prepare for future outbreaks,” Peeni Henare said.Willie Jackson said today’s announcement was a culmination of work done between the Ministry of Health and Te Puni Kōkiri.“This funding is about supporting those who are most vulnerable, whānau Māori. We know what’s happening on the ground within our communities and the importance of vaccinations,” Willie Jackson said“This announcement demonstrates the Government’s willingness and confidence to invest in Maori providers to deliver to our communities. That’s why TPK will kick-in $2 million immediately to get the project underway,” Willie Jackson said.The $2 million is part of a $5 million reprioritised fund from the COVID-19, 2021 Whānau Recovery Fund, announced earlier this month to provide immediate relief to vulnerable whānau Māori and communities during the current COVID-19 outbreak. The $2 million will go to Māori health providers who work directly with TPK, supporting community driven, local responses to gaps in access and provision of critical services such as vaccination.“I am incredibly proud of our Māori health providers and the work they do for whānau Māori. Their passion and dedication to their communities is an exemplar for the rest of the health and disability system – me mihi ka tika,” Peeni Henare said.Media notesThe $36 million (Ministry of Health) will be split across four priority areas:$17 million has been allocated to help providers adapt their services to support the COVID-19 response, whilst also maintaining their other essential health services. This funding will also resource additional staffing requirements and offer any staff wellbeing support to sustain the workforce.$14 million will help whānau access health services, medications, and hygiene products. It will also help provide greater reach of vaccination, testing, and other health services to hard-to-reach areas.$3 million will strengthen the Māori psychosocial response, ensuring whānau have access to mental health and wellbeing services.$2 million will ensure providers have sufficient funding to manage the long tail of this response, sustain their efforts, and help them prepare for future outbreaks.This funding will be distributed to providers through both existing contracts and a streamlined contestable process. Providers who are already part of the COVID-19 Māori health response with current contracts will be able to assess this funding through a variation to contract and for other providers, there will be an application process.The Ministry of Health will provide additional details on their website.The $2 million (Te Puni Kokiri) will be funded towards:$2 million to assist Māori health providers who work directly with TPK to support community driven, local responses to gaps in access and provision of critical services such as vaccination.To apply for funding, Māori and iwi organisations need to contact their local Te Puni Kōkiri office:https://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/whakapa-mai","Publication Date: 21 September 2021

Govt providing business the tools to vaccinate workforces,"Simplified vaccination assessment tool will be able to be used mid-December to help employers decide if they would require vaccination for different types of work.Workers covered by the My Vaccine Pass mandate need to have their first dose by 3 December and be fully vaccinated by 17 January 2022.The Government is building on measures to protect businesses and workers from COVID-19as the country gets ready to transition to the new COVID-19 Protection Framework on December 3, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced today.“Employers and employees have been asking for certainty on what roles may need to be done by vaccinated workers under the COVID-19 Protection Framework,” Michael Wood said.“Vaccine requirements in the workplace are a common tool many countries around the world are using to stop the spread of COVID and to protect their workers and customers from the virus.“We’ve developed a tool to help clarify what work should be covered by vaccinated workers which is simple and clear for assessing when it is reasonable to require vaccination for other work.“This tool provides a clear, legal framework to help businesses make decisions about vaccinations in the workplace.It builds on the guidance provided by WorkSafe and has had input from BusinessNZ and the CTU. The tool will specify four key factors, at least three of which must be met, before it would be reasonable to require vaccination for particular work.“This new process won’t override risk assessments that businesses have already done under the existing health and safety guidelines.Businesses can choose which one they use, and any assessments done to date remain valid.“We understand that businesses and workers need certainty. Legislation allowing the vaccination assessment tool to be created, as well as introducing four weeks’ paid notice of termination and paid time off to get vaccinated, will be passed under urgency this week. This legislation will come into effect the day after it is passed. The assessment tool will then be available for businesses to use once regulations are made in mid-December under the amended law.“It’s common sense to ensure staff in workplaces that are either required to or can use the My Vaccine Pass are vaccinated. This is regardless of whether the business chooses to require My Vaccine Passes from customers or attendees. It gives confidence to the customers who are vaccinated and means the business will be less likely to be affected by cases.“We have tested this requirement with stakeholders, and it has received broad support, including from religious communities. Everyone wants to keep their staff, customers and congregations safe.“This requirement to be vaccinated applies to hospitality, events, close contact businesses and gyms. To continue doing work in these areas, workers will need to have their first vaccination by the day that the COVID-19 Protection Framework comes into effect, which will be Friday December 3. These workers will need to be fully vaccinated by 17 January 2022 to continue doing that work.“91 per cent of New Zealanders have already had one dose of the vaccine, so for the overwhelming majority this requirement isn’t an issue. For those who are not yet vaccinated, especially workers in areas where My Vaccine Passes can be applied, there are 10 days left to get your first dose. It is free, safe and the most effective way to keep you, your whānau, business and customers safe. It’s a simple contribution to keeping all New Zealanders safe from COVID-19,” Michael Wood said.","Publication Date: 23 November 2021

New Zealand to donate further COVID_19 vaccines to Tonga and Samoa,"Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Associate Health Minister Aupito William Sio today announced that New Zealand is donating further Pfizer vaccines to Tonga and Samoa.“Aotearoa New Zealand is donating an additional 9,300 doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to Tonga, and 10,000 doses to Samoa,” Nanaia Mahuta said.“These donations are part of Aotearoa New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to global vaccination efforts and are part of our plans to support vaccine rollout in the Pacific.”“These vaccines will enable frontline workers and vulnerable populations to access a booster as early as possible,” Aupito William Sio said.“Both Samoa and Tonga have done an impressive job of vaccinating their people against COVID-19.”“With Tonga now in lockdown and COVID-19 detected at the border in Samoa, ensuring populations are boosted will play a key role in mitigating the impacts of an outbreak,” Nanaia Mahuta said.Following the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption and tsunami, New Zealand has provided $3 million to Tonga in humanitarian funding. A Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules has departed Base Auckland Whenuapai earlier today carrying the vaccines, rapid antigen tests, and equipment to support re-establishing the electrical network.This donation brings New Zealand’s total vaccine donations to over 47,000 for Tonga and 94,000 for Samoa.","Publication Date: 5 February 2022

Young people aged 16 and 17 eligible for COVID_19 boosters,"From tomorrow, young people aged 16 and 17 can receive a free booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine at least six months after completing their primary course, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins has announced.This follows Medsafe’s provisional approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) as a booster dose for this age group.“This decision is great news and means that from tomorrow, around 36,000 rangatahi aged 16 and 17 years will be eligible to receive a booster dose,” Chris Hipkins said.“They can do this by visiting any walk-in vaccination clinic around the country.“A booster dose is particularly recommended for 16- and 17-year-olds who’re at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalisation.  This includes those who’re immunocompromised or living with a family member who is immunocompromised, and Māori and Pacific rangatahi.“Decisions like this are another important step in helping us protect all New Zealanders, especially as we get closer to the winter months.“We know that over time, immunity to the virus wanes, so getting the booster gives the best protection against COVID-19.“This is also a reminder to any New Zealander who hasn’t yet had their booster, that even if you’ve already had COVID-19, getting a booster at least 3 months after you test positive helps reduce the risk of being re-infected and passing it on to others.“It also reduces the chances of you becoming very ill and ending up in hospital.“This decision on booster doses for our young people protects more New Zealanders from the risk of serious complications from COVID-19.“I also want to recognise theteam at Medsafe who’ve worked hard to assess all COVID-19 vaccine applications.“Medsafe follows a robust approval process to ensure all the vaccines we use in New Zealand meet acceptable standards for safety, quality and efficacy.”Notes:You can check when you are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzIf your second dose was six months ago you can get your booster by:finding a walk-in vaccination centre atBookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).From 14 April, to allow time for technical integration of the decision into the digital booking system, this group will be able to book throughBookMyVaccine.nz.From14 April,you’ll also be able to book for yourself or make a whānau booking (group bookings for more than one person) by calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).Interpretation services, and text, email and NZ Relay options for deaf and hearing impaired are available if you need them on 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).

Govt purchases enough Pfizer vaccines for whole country,"The Government has guaranteed that every New Zealander will have access to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, after securing an additional 8.5 million doses, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.“The Government has signed an advance purchase agreement for 8.5 million additional doses, enough to vaccinate 4.25 million people. The vaccines are expected to arrive in New Zealand during the second half of the year,” Jacinda Ardern said.“This brings our total Pfizer order to 10 million doses or enough for 5 million people to get the two shots needed to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.”The Government’s original agreement with Pfizer was for approximately 1.5 million doses, enough to vaccinate 750,000 people.“The decision to make Pfizer New Zealand’s primary vaccine provider, was based on the fact the Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection.“It also means all New Zealanders will have the chance to access the same vaccine.“Whilst the Pfizer vaccine does need to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, this challenge is offset by only having to deal with one vaccine, rather than multiple vaccines with multiple protocols. It will simplify our vaccine roll out.“This purchase marks a significant milestone in New Zealand’s fight against COVID-19. We can take heart that we’ve now secured one of the strongest and more effective tools in the COVID-19 toolkit.“With every person who gets vaccinated, New Zealand gets one step closer to moving away from restrictions to manage COVID-19,” Jacinda Ardern said.“This is a significant addition to our COVID-19 vaccine portfolio. It indicates our confidence in the vaccine’s performance to date and our demonstrated ability to administer it,” COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said.“The Ministry of Health is now working with Pfizer on a delivery schedule for the additional vaccines which will ensure a smooth rollout and a scaling up of our vaccination programme as we start to immunise the general public from the middle of the year.“Consideration is also being given to how best to use vaccine doses that don’t end up being needed in New Zealand. We are working on options for donating surplus doses across our wider portfolio to the Pacific and developing countries worldwide.“We are committed to ensuring that any doses not needed here are put to good use elsewhere. Options could include delaying delivery to New Zealand, in order to free up supply for other countries in the short-term, or donating spare vaccines to other countries.“We are also working closely with the Realm countries of Niue, Tokelau, and the Cook Islands, as well as our close neighbours Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu to provide access to our vaccine portfolio and provide wider support for vaccine roll-out,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 8 March 2021

Economic resilience provides more options in Budget 2021,"Securing the recovery and investing in the wellbeing of New Zealanders is the focus of Budget 2021, Grant Robertson told his audience at a pre-budget speech in Auckland this morning.""The economy has proven resilient in response to COVID-19, due to people having confidence in the Government’s health response to keep them safe.  Unemployment has continued to trend down, an extra 32,000 jobs have been created in the six months to March and business and consumer confidence is increasing as our vaccine rollout is ramping up and we are carefully opening up our borders.”“We can’t take the recovery for granted. Further waves of COVID-19 around the world underline that we are still in a highly volatile and uncertain global environment.  There are still sectors and regions in New Zealand struggling to deal with the impacts of the pandemic. We have also taken on considerable debt to support New Zealanders lives and livelihoods through COVID-19.“In this environment a balanced approached is required. We need to continue to be careful with our management of the economy, while also providing stimulus to accelerate the recovery and to make investments where they are needed the most to tackle our long term challenges in priority areas such as climate change, child wellbeing and housing.“Our better than expected economic recovery does provide us with more options. There is a bit more space in our operating and capital allowances to support the economy in line with our wellbeing approach while also providing further scope to keep a lid on our higher debt levels and then lower it once the recovery is secure.“An investment-focused recovery that supports all New Zealanders is the way to ensure that our finances remain sustainable. It is also the way in which the Government will continue to tackle the long-standing issues that we were elected to address.“It is important to recognise that it can’t all be done in one budget. I view this budget as one of a package of three this term to advance our priorities and return our books to a sustainable fiscal position,” Grant Robertson said.","Publication Date: 10 May 2021

Updated My Vaccine Pass for those who want it,"Updated pass can be downloaded from 24 May for people 12 and overPeople encouraged to stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinationsBoosters included in up-to-date My Vaccine Pass for those 18 and overNew Zealanders who are up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations will be able to download an updated My Vaccine Pass from 24 May, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.“Since the introduction of My Vaccine Pass last year, the COVID-19 vaccination landscape has changed. While My Vaccine Pass is not legally required, people are encouraged to have their pass for when it might be needed,” Chris Hipkins said.Updated My Vaccine Passes will be available for anyone aged 12 and over who is up to date with their vaccinations for their age group and for the type of vaccine they have received, and this includes boosters for those over 18.“In early April 2022 the legal requirement for businesses to use My Vaccine Passes was removed. Some businesses may be voluntarily keeping My Vaccine Pass requirements as a condition of entry.“For this reason, it is a good idea to have an up-to-date My Vaccine Pass handy in case you are asked for it. I encourage everyone to stay up-to-date with their vaccinations and download their updated pass as it’s an important record of their vaccination status.“We’ve learnt over the last couple of years there are no certainties with COVID-19 and with new variants circling the globe, it’s best we’re prepared for every eventuality,” Chris Hipkins said.An updated My Vaccine Passes will have an expiry date six months from the date of issue. The pass can be requested at any time provided people continue to be up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations.The updated My Vaccine Pass will have a slightly different look to the current version and a refreshed design, but it will still have a QR code.Anyone aged 12 and over can get a My Vaccine Pass if they have had their recommended COVID-19 vaccinations.5 to 11-year-oldsNot available for this age group12 to 17-year-oldsTwo primary doses18 years and overTwo primary doses, plus a booster","Publication Date: 13 May 2022

More freezers and South Island hub to support vaccine roll_out,"A South Island hub and 17 new ultra-low temperature freezers will help further prepare New Zealand for the ramp up of the vaccination programme in the second half of this year, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.The new freezers arrived in New Zealand on 27 May. They’re currently being tested and accredited and will be ready for use by the end of this month.“This is the next step in getting the country ready to deliver 50,000 vaccinations a day at the peak of our vaccination campaign,” Chris Hipkins says.“Five of the new freezers have arrived in Christchurch, adding to the two already there, to ensure we have a second hub with capacity to deliver vaccines across the South Island and lower North Island.“The 12 remaining ultra-low temperature freezers will be based in Auckland, bringing the total number to 26 freezers – 23 operating and three as back-up – across New Zealand.“This will be enough storage for four million doses at any one time.”Having two vaccination hubs and back-up freezers prepares New Zealand for any potential risks, such as earthquakes or other major disruptions to the roll-out.“This is the largest and most complex exercise the health system in New Zealand has ever undertaken and we want to ensure we are prepared for anything.”All shipments of the Pfizer vaccine currently go to Auckland, but as larger shipments start to arrive they will be flown direct to both Auckland and Christchurch for packing and distribution. The freezers cost up to $20,000 each.","Publication Date: 9 June 2021

Funding for Pacific Community as we get ready for Omicron,"The Government is providing a $1.5 million dollar boost to the Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund. This will directly support Pacific community-led initiatives to encourage boosters and child vaccinations, said the Associate Minister of Health Aupito William Sio.“The vaccine plays an important part in our preparations for Omicron. We need to ensure our 5–11-year-old Pacific children are vaccinated and that all of our eligible Pacific peoples get their booster when they become due. It’s critical that we vaccinate our children before the coming winter .“We’ve seen overseas how fast Omicron can overwhelm health care systems and impact essential services. Vaccination is the first step our families can take to prepare for Omicron.“The Pacific community’s response to vaccinations has been excellent. National vaccination figures show that 97 percent have received their first dose, and 94 percent are fully vaccinated with two doses.“However, data for booster uptake shows Pacific rates are still low in comparison with other communities in Aotearoa.Only 32 percent of Pacific people due for a booster have received one so far compared to 42 percent of Māori.“It’s important our Pacific communities continue with their great response to vaccinations. This top up of the Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund will ensure our communities have the resources to achieve the high vaccination rates we need to keep safe,” said Aupito William Sio.Pacific community groups predominantly in Tāmaki Makauraucan apply for funding although groups from around Aotearoa are welcome to apply.Community groups, Pacific churches, Pacific youth groups and other groups that work with marginalised Pacific communities will be eligible to apply for up to $40,000.The Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund,which is being managed by The Cause Collective, will run until 30 June 2022 or when funds have been fully distributed.“Through this fund we are asking our Pacific communities to prepare for Omicron by getting your booster and vaccinating our young children. Omicron will challenge all of us, we will need to be ready in advance. We’ve met the challenge many times before, we must meet it again,” said Aupito William Sio.Editors notesThe Cause Collective is a social change organisation focused on the wellbeing of Pacific peoples and South Auckland communities.www.thecausecollective.org.nzThe organisation runs the Prepare Pacific campaign for the Northern Region’s District Health Boards Covid-19 Pacific Response in Auckland.www.preparepacific.nzandhttps://www.facebook.com/preparepacific","Publication Date: 2 February 2022

Government releases expert advice on Reconnecting New Zealanders,"Group recommends phased re-opening of borderMore infectious Delta variant requires high vaccine uptake before border can be safely openedSuggests risk based factors be taken into account at border such as vaccination status and Covid-19 prevalence in countries visitedGroup confirms the viability of maintaining elimination strategyThe Government has released the expert advice of the Strategic Covid-19 Public Health Advisory Group led by Professor Sir David Skegg on how to approach the reopening of New Zealand’s borders.The advice, commissioned by Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall, suggests a phased re-opening of New Zealand’s border once the vaccination programme is fully rolled out, and sets out the preparatory work needed now.“The emergence of the Delta variant has altered both the advice provided and our approach to reconnecting with the world,” Ayesha Verrall said.“We need to do more to further strengthen our borders and bolster our health defences, including through the vaccine rollout, before we can safely open the border further, and that will take a little more time to properly prepare.“Achieving high rates of vaccination is critical to provide protection for individuals from being infected and becoming seriously ill. It will support a safe re-opening of New Zealand’s borders by protecting whānau and the wider community, by making it less likely that the virus will spread,” Ayesha Verrall said.“The Group recommends a phased approach to slowly admitting more travellers to New Zealand, without needing to go into MIQ, based on risk based factors such as their vaccination status and the state of the pandemic in their country of origin,” Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said.“The Group proposes these travellers would still be subject to a number of requirements, such as proof of vaccination, pre-departure testing and rapid testing on arrival in New Zealand.“The Group recommends preparatory work begins now, including seeking advice on rapid testing at airports, along with a strengthening of public health and social measures, such as expanding health system capability and contact tracing capacity, and mandating QR scanning at some types of venues - of which work is already underway by the Government,” Chris Hipkins said.The advice also confirms the viability of maintaining our Elimination Strategy as international travel resumes.“The Elimination Strategy, defined as a zero tolerance to new cases, has served us incredibly well in keeping cases of Covid-19 out of the community and stamping out cases when they do arise,” Ayesha Verrall said.“The advice confirms that maintaining the Elimination Strategy does not mean our border settings must remain as they are.“Provided that a high level of vaccination coverage is achieved, reliance on population-wide measures such as lockdowns can be reduced and the Elimination Strategy maintained through more targeted public health measures, such as testing and contact tracing.“According to the advice, continuing with our Elimination Strategy is not only viable, but optimal, as we re-open borders, and will be key to protecting New Zealanders and maintaining our future options,” Ayesha Verrall said.The Group, chaired by Sir David Skegg, is made up of experts in epidemiology, infectious diseases and public health, and has provided independent advice on our ongoing COVID-19 response.Membership of the Group is:Sir David Skegg, ChairAssociate Prof Nikki Turner, MemberProf Philip Hill, MemberDr Maia Brewerton, MemberProf David Murdoch, MemberDr Ella Iosua, MemberRodney Jones, Special AdvisorProfessor Shaun Hendy, Special Advisor","Publication Date: 11 August 2021

More COVID medicines for most at_risk New Zealanders,"First batch of the 60,000 courses of Paxlovid coming this year has arrived and will be used from next week.Pharmac secures access to preventative COVID treatment Evusheld.New Zealand is boosting its comprehensive suite of medicines to treat COVID-19 with the arrival in the country of one medication, Paxlovid, and the securing of access to the country’s first pre-exposure prophylactic treatment, Health Minister Andrew Little has announced.“Two years ago, at the start of the pandemic, we had no vaccines or medicines to specifically treat COVID-19 or prevent it spreading,” Andrew Little said.“Now, we have four vaccines and 95 per cent of eligible people are vaccinated. And we’ve got four medicines being used in hospitals now to treat people who need it – Baricitinib, Ronapreve, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab.“From next week we’ll be adding Paxlovid to the mix – pills that people with mild cases who are at the highest risk of becoming seriously unwell can take at home.“The first shipment of Paxlovid has arrived in New Zealand ahead of schedule and will start being offered to those most at risk from next week, protecting people from getting seriously ill and the health system from being overwhelmed.“Access to Paxlovid will be tight to make sure it gets to the people who need it most. It will be prescribed by doctors, with factors such as age, disability and being immuno-compromised taken into account.”Pharmac, the national medicines-funding agency, has also secured access to another medicine, Molnupiravir, which is awaiting Medsafe approval.“That’s six medicines, and I am very pleased with the news today that Pharmac has secured access to a seventh, AstraZeneca’s Evusheld, which can prevent people who can’t have vaccines from getting COVID-19,” Andrew Little said.“Evusheld is a pre-exposure prophylactic treatment that can actually stop people developing COVID-19, and, if approved by Medsafe, will be an invaluable tool to protect people who can’t have vaccines.“It means we will have medicines to treat those who need it, from before an infection sets in right through to cases of severe infection. It’s a remarkable achievement in two years, and part of our plan to keep New Zealanders safe as we head into winter.“The emergence of highly effective vaccines and medicines means we can better manage COVID-19 while reopening our borders and easing restrictions. They mean we can shift our focus towards recovery more secure in the knowledge we have a highly vaccinated population and those most at risk of the virus will also have medicines to help protect them.”Funding for all COVID medicines comes from the Government’s COVID-19 fund.Editors’ notes:How is Evusheld different from a vaccine?Vaccination uses a person’s immune system to create antibodies that provide protection against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.  Monoclonal antibody treatments such as Evusheld allow antibodies that provide protection against COVID-19 to be given directly to a patient and does not require a patient’s immune system to create these antibodies.  This means Evusheld is a particularly useful treatment for people who are immunocompromised and would not be able to generate antibodies in response to vaccination against COVID-19.Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination against COVID-19 but it does provide an option for the small group of people who are not able to be vaccinatedMore information about New Zealand’s COVID medicines can be found onPharmac's website.","Publication Date: 31 March 2022

Prime Minister meets with key ASEAN and East Asia Summit partners,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern today attended the ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit and discussed with Leaders a range of shared challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region, including:The ongoing management of the COVID-19 pandemic;The importance of working collectively to accelerate economic recovery; andExploring further opportunities for partners to work more closely on health, economic and security issues facing the region.The ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit, which was held digitally, also marked the 45th anniversary of the diplomatic partnership between the two parties.“New Zealand and ASEAN share a strong legacy of working together to advance peace and prosperity in our region. ASEAN is our fourth largest trading partner, a crucial defence and security partner, and a critical strategic hub that connects us to Asia and the rest of the world,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Our partnership will play an important role as our countries work together to support global efforts to manage the pandemic and ensure fair and equitable access to safe vaccines, and drive economic recovery through maintaining open markets for our exporters and resilient supply chains,” Jacinda Ardern said.The Prime Minister, through a joint statement with Leaders, reaffirmed New Zealand’s commitment to strengthening its partnership with ASEAN under the themes of “Peace, Prosperity, People and Planet”, which will promote cooperation in areas such as sustainability and climate change, trade facilitation and digital commerce.Later tonight the Prime Minister will also digitally attend the East Asia Summit (EAS), the region’s premier forum for leaders to discuss pressing strategic issues facing our region.“The meeting will be a good chance to exchange views with other leaders on the pandemic and issues such as the South China Sea and climate change,” Jacinda Ardern said.Note to editors:The Joint Statement released by the Prime Ministers at the ASEAN-New Zealand CommemorativeSummit is included below.The ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit is a five-yearly meeting between Heads of State/Government of ASEAN and New Zealand.The ASEAN has 10 members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam).Established in 2005, the East Asia Summit is now the premier Leaders political and security forum in the Indo-Pacific. Leaders meet annually and discuss issues and emerging challenges that concern them the most.The East Asia Summit comprises ASEAN plus eight dialogue partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, US).Joint ASEAN-New Zealand Leaders’ Vision Statement on the 45thAnniversary of ASEAN-New Zealand Dialogue Relations:A Legacy of Partnership, A Future Together1. We, the Heads of State/Government of the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and New Zealand, met via videoconference on 14 November 2020, under Viet Nam’s 2020 ASEAN Chairmanship, to commemorate the 45thAnniversary of ASEAN-New Zealand Dialogue Relations.2. The ASEAN-New Zealand Leaders’ Commemorative Summit marks an important milestone in the ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership, as both sides share a strong legacy, and have achieved much over the past 45 years across a wide range of areas, including political, security, trade and economic, people-to-people, and development cooperation.3. We reaffirm our mutual respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality, and independence, as espoused in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC), and reiterate our determination to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for international law.4. We share deep concern over the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the lives of people as well as economies around the world. Our thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones or who are suffering from the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. We recognise the heroic efforts of medical professionals, healthcare workers, and other front-liners around the world, and dedicate ourselves to close partnership in pursuit of recovery.5. We acknowledge the progress achieved in the full implementation of the Plan of Action to Implement the Joint Statement for ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership (2016– 2020), and its two key strategies, namely the “People Strategy” and the “Prosperity Strategy”, which have enhanced cooperation and contributed towards the realisation of the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and its Blueprints.6. As we look to the future, we underscore the importance of the ASEAN-New Zealand strategic partnership, and the principle of genuine, mutually-beneficial cooperation that has underpinned our dialogue relations for the past 45 years. In this context, we reaffirm our commitment to upholding a stable, rules-based international order; maintaining an open and inclusive region where people enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms; reinforcing the multilateral trading system through deeper and more ambitious economic integration; and building on the region’s sustainable development agenda with an emphasis on environmental resilience and collective action which addresses climate change. To this end, we will redouble our collective efforts to achieve the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 – a year which will mark New Zealand’s fiftieth anniversary of dialogue partnership with ASEAN.7. Consequently, we welcome efforts toward the realization of the Plan of Action to Implement the ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership (2021-2025), focusing cooperation under the four key themes of “Peace, Prosperity, People, and Planet”, which are in line with the three pillars of ASEAN Community, namely Political-SecurityCommunity, Economic Community, and Socio-Cultural Community, to reflect ASEAN and New Zealand’s ambition to strengthen and deepen our Strategic Partnership.PEACE8. We reaffirm our shared commitment to maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes. We further reaffirm our dedication to an open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based regional architecture, which respects the sovereignty of all states regardless of their size; which is based on key principles such as adherence to international law and open markets; and which is built on ASEAN-led mechanisms. We therefore reiterate our determination to promote shared values and norms including those enshrined in the ASEAN Charter, the Charter of the United Nations, and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.9. In recognition of the vital role of regional and multilateral institutions, we therefore reiterate the importance of regular and comprehensive ASEAN-New Zealand dialogue and cooperation, as well as engagement in ASEAN-led frameworks such as the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus). We reaffirm our interest in exploring possible cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and New Zealand’s priorities for the Indo-Pacific, in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace, freedom, and prosperity in the region and beyond.10. In light of our shared goal of regional peace and stability, we will continue to work together on confidence-building and preventive diplomacy, including through the ASEAN Regional Forum process, and to address regional security challenges, including through cooperation to promote cybersecurity, combat transnational organised crime and cybercrime, strengthen border security, counter terrorism, and promote social inclusiveness to prevent violent extremism. We recognise New Zealand’s long-standing support to demining activities in the region, including through regional mechanisms. We also welcome opportunities to share expertise and build capacity of defence officials.11. We reaffirm our mutual dedication to disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and in light of its fiftieth anniversary, we recognise the instrumental role of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in supporting international efforts to curtail the threats posed by nuclear weapons and their proliferation. In this context, we note the opportunities for cooperation between ASEAN and New Zealand on the South East Asia Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone (SEANWFZ) and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone.12. We reiterate the importance of promoting maritime security and safety, freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded commerce, mutual trust and confidence, the exercise of self-restraint, the non-use of force or of the threat to use force, and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),and compliance with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization and relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization.PROSPERITY13. We note the strong trade and business links between ASEAN countries and New Zealand, with two-way trade between ASEAN and New Zealand growing by almost two-thirds in the past ten years. These links will stand us in good stead in mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic. We therefore affirm our determination to work together to advance regional economic integration, resist all forms of protectionism, and ensure resilient supply chains that facilitate the unimpeded flow of goods and services. As highly trade-oriented economies, we rededicate ourselves to supporting the rules-based multilateral trading system, which underpins our region’s economic growth and sustainable development, and to ensuring that the WTO is forward-looking, reformed, and well-positioned to tackle 21stcentury trade challenges.14. We therefore welcome the decision to officially launch negotiations to upgrade the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement in early 2021, to ensure it remains a visionary and precedent-setting agreement, which delivers tangible benefits to our businesses, consumers, and peoples, and which demonstrates the genuine economic partnership between ASEAN and New Zealand. We also look forward to the signing and implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which will facilitate stronger trade and business ties, and support regional economic integration efforts.15. To this end, we will redouble our efforts to deepen practical economic cooperation, improve business linkages, and support human capital development in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, noting the importance of science, technology and innovation for 21stcentury economies. We therefore welcome New Zealand’s interest in supporting ASEAN’s post-pandemic economic recovery efforts, taking into account the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, including through engagement to improve ease of doing business, enhance the region’s digital transformation, and strengthen the resilience of supply chains. In support of these efforts, we encourage the early conclusion of a high-quality ASEAN-New Zealand regional Air Services Agreement, to provide a more open environment for air links and to facilitate greater ease of movement of people and goods, and look forward to the successor programme of the AANZFTA Economic Cooperation Support Programme.PEOPLE16. We welcome the understanding and friendships that have developed between the peoples of ASEAN and New Zealand, including as a result of our People-to-People programmes. With a view to building greater awareness of ASEAN-New Zealand relations, we endeavour to strengthen further those links through two-way exchanges, scholarships, and short-term specialist training programmes such as English language training, and technical vocational education and training, by promoting the diverse and rich culture in ASEAN Member States and New Zealand, and by exploring other opportunities for building capacity for economic and social development, with a particular focus on opportunities that build links between our youth, young leaders, and entrepreneurs.17. We reaffirm our efforts to promote good governance at all levels, and to realise vibrant and inclusive societies that promote high quality of life and equitable access to opportunities for all, whose members enjoy human rights, and which promote social protection for vulnerable groups.18. We acknowledge the on-going threat of communicable and emerging infectious diseases, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, and reaffirm the value in strengthening cooperation and sharing information to enable collective, coordinated and comprehensive responses to such events, which require a whole of government and whole of society approach. We express our support for global initiatives that ensure the fair and equitable global access to and distribution of safe, effective, and affordable COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, including but not limited to the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility and Advance Market Commitment; and underscore the importance of strong, resilient and sustainable supply chains, in order to effectively facilitate trade and to ensure the unimpeded flow of goods and services, including medical supplies, medicines and vaccines, food, commodities and other essential supplies and services in the region. We also welcome New Zealand’s contribution to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund.PLANET19. We acknowledge that as political leaders we carry responsibility for the sustainable management, effective conservation, and responsible stewardship of our lands and forests, our environment, and our people. We therefore recognise the importance of working together to ensure a sustainable and climate-resilient economic recovery, as well as exploring support for initiatives which strengthen the region’s capabilities on environmental protection, climate change and sustainability issues, including the implementation of the Paris Agreement; promote renewable energy, the sustainable management of natural resources, and the conservation of forests and biological diversity; combat marine plastic debris; and address Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing. In this regard, New Zealand highlighted the Māori concept of kaitiakitanga, which emphasises the importance of caring for and protecting peoples and places for future generations.20. We reiterate the importance of continuing to work together on disaster management to enhance disaster awareness and strengthen respective capabilities in disaster risk reduction, mitigation, prevention, preparedness and response, and recovery, including under the ambit of ASEAN-led mechanisms and initiatives.21. To give effect to this, we welcome New Zealand’s efforts to promote climate-smart agriculture in ASEAN, with a focus on improving food security while addressing efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage officials working on climate change to strengthen engagement. We also welcome New Zealand’s interest in promoting sustainable water management in the Mekong sub-region, including through its contribution to the Mekong River Commission.CROSS-PILLAR COOPERATION22. We underscore the importance of enhancing cross-pillar cooperation and the role that the seamless movement of people, goods and services plays in bringing the peoples of ASEAN and New Zealand closer together, as well as building strong links throughout the region, including with Pacific Island countries. In this regard, we will continue to work together in support of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) 2025, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan IV (2021-2025), and the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN).23. We will also redouble our efforts toward the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in our region, including through the promotion of complementarities between the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Complementarities Initiative).24. In support of all our work, we will continue our efforts to embed the principles of good governance, and to foster transparent, accountable, participatory and effective governance, throughout the region; including by strengthening the capacity of the ASEAN Secretariat and appropriate ASEAN entities.As we adopt this Joint Vision Statement, we reflect on the long history of genuine friendship between ASEAN and New Zealand, including New Zealand's contributions to the region as one of ASEAN's oldest dialogue partners. We therefore task our relevant officials to bear this spirit of partnership in mind as we implement and realise our vision identified in this Joint Statement and the Plan of Action 2021-2025, as well as other existing ASEAN-New Zealand frameworks for cooperation.","Publication Date: 14 November 2020

Two million flu shots for COVID winter plan,"The Government is ramping up the flu vaccination campaign which starts today, with 40 per cent more flu shots available this year as part of the COVID-19 winter plan.New Zealand usually uses about 1.4 million flu vaccines a year. This year, the Government is making two million available and is widening eligibility for people to get vaccinated for free.“With the Omicron wave still working its way through the country, we need to protect our most vulnerable from getting the flu as well, and our health system from coming under more pressure,” Health Minister Andrew Little said.“We already make the flu shot available for free for everyone over the age of 65, and for those who are pregnant or at risk of becoming seriously ill because of other underlying conditions.“This winter, on the advice of doctors, we’re widening eligibility to include Māori and Pacific people aged 55 and over, which means an extra 39,000 people can have the vaccine for free.”Andrew Little urged as many people as possible to get the vaccine.“In an ordinary year, flu kills more than 500 New Zealanders. And this is no ordinary year,” he said.“Every year, about half the people eligible for free vaccination take it up. For the past two years, with the country closed to the rest of the world because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve been largely free of colds and flu.“That’s changing, though, with our borders opening, and I encourage everyone – and especially the most vulnerable – to get vaccinated. Anyone who is part of Group Three for the COVID vaccination rollout should make sure they get a flu shot.“The programme is being rolled out across the country from today, with vaccinations available from family doctors, pharmacists and some Māori and Pacific health providers.“We’re looking at ways to increase the vaccination workforce to get flu shots to those who need them. We have trained and authorised many new pharmacist vaccinators over the past two years, including provisional pharmacist vaccinators who are able to administer the influenza vaccine.”The $12 million expansion programme is being funded from the Government’s COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.","Publication Date: 1 April 2022

Workplace vaccination requirements extended to cover Police and NZ Defence Force,"With the support of the organisations, additional vaccination requirements will cover sworn members, recruits and authorised officers of the New Zealand Police, and all New Zealand Defence Force staff.First doses of the vaccine for workers in these organisations are required by 17 January 2022, and second doses by 1 March 2022.These groups are added to the list of sectors covered by vaccination, which includes MIQ and border work, healthcare, education, and prisons.Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced today that workplace vaccination requirements will be extended to include the New Zealand Police and Defence Force in preparation for the transition to the new COVID-19 Protection Framework on 3 December 2021.Ministers have worked with Police and Defence Force leadership on this, and there is broad support for the decision.“Vaccination is our greatest tool in keeping New Zealanders safe, so we have extended vaccine requirements to include constabulary, recruits and authorised officers of New Zealand Police, and the armed forces and civilian staff of the New Zealand Defence Force,” Michael Wood said.“So many of the individuals within these organisations have been essential to our COVID-19 response and are already fully vaccinated. But we want to ensure that those who serve and protect our communities on a daily basis can do so without unintentionally spreading the virus,” Michael Wood said.First doses of vaccinations for workers in these organisations will be required by 17 January 2022, and second doses by 1 March 2022.“We already have a very high vaccination rate in the Police and it makes sense operationally to make it a requirement for the constabulary, recruits and authorised officers who have regular contact with members to be vaccinated. This is about keeping Police safe and the community safe. 92.2 per cent of all Constabulary Police staff have received at least one dose, and 86.5 per cent are now fully vaccinated. As they are often in contact with vulnerable communities, this is the best way that we can protect our Police staff and the public from COVID-19,” Police Minister Poto Williams said.“The NZDF provide critical services to New Zealand, including assisting Police at regional borders, and supporting MBIE in resourcing MIQ facilities. It makes sense that they are included in the mandate and most of the NZDF’s Regular Force are already vaccinated. Our defence forces can be deployed at any time to locations where they may come into contact with COVID-19. For example, the recent mission to Afghanistan saw our defence force personnel assisting in the evacuation of New Zealand visa holders, some of whom had COVID,” Defence Minister Peeni Henare said.NZDF uniformed personnel are currently 98.4 per cent fully vaccinated and civilian staff are already 75 per cent fully vaccinated through the NZDF vaccination programme delivered earlier this year. These rates do not include those who may have received vaccinations through the public health system.“While a number of other sectors have requested additional government vaccination requirements we are not progressing them at this time. Vaccine mandates are very strong legal requirements that have to be carefully considered based on a clear assessment about how justifiable they are, “Michael Wood said.“An increasingly large proportion of the population is double-dosed with thousands more getting vaccinated every day, and the simple vaccination assessment tool that will be available for businesses in mid-December will help to streamline the process,” Michael Wood said.","Publication Date: 26 November 2021

Govt makes COVID_19 vaccinations mandatory for more border jobs,"The Government is further strengthening the border against COVID-19 by making it mandatory for more of the workforce to be vaccinated, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.“To prevent the virus getting into our communities, we must continue to strengthen our border by protecting the people who work there,” Chris Hipkins said.The new COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2021 comes into effect at 11:59pm on 14 July 2021.“As well as workers at Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) facilities, workers at our ports and airports who are at the greatest risk of exposure to COVID-19 must now be vaccinated,” Chris Hipkins said.“The vaccination of MIQ workers has been successful so far. Latest numbers show there were 4,332 MIQ workers on site for the week ending 4 July, all of whom were vaccinated. No unvaccinated worker can enter an MIQ facility.“Of the active air border workers, 82 percent are fully vaccinated and 2 percent have received a single dose and await their second.“However only 54 percent of active port workers have been fully vaccinated, and we need to see this number increased to avoid the risk of COVID-19 entering the country via our ports.“I am extending the mandatory order to cover a further 1800 currently unvaccinated active border workers. This is necessary to lift the uptake of the vaccine among the wider border workforce and strengthen our ongoing response to COVID-19.“I’d also encourage border employers to look at opportunities to make it easy for their workers to get vaccine appointments and to urge employees to get their vaccination. It is in their interests to keep COVID-19 out and their businesses open by having a vaccinated workforce.”The legislation allows for a reasonable window for vaccination. All government employees covered by the order must have had their first dose by 26 August, while privately employed border workers must have had their first dose by 30 September. New workers covered by the Order (regardless of employer) will need to have their first dose before starting work.“Border workers who remain unvaccinated after the requirements come into effect will need to discuss options with their employer. They will not be able to continue working in a high-risk border environment until they are vaccinated,” Chris Hipkins said.The expanded Order applies to people working at:MIQFs and MIFs (previously covered)airside area of affected airports and some other higher-risk work at airportsaffected portsaccommodation services where specified aircrew members are self-isolating.It also includes work:that involves handling affected items removed from ships, aircraft or MIQFs or MIFs, ANDwhere the job is for a company that is routinely engaged to provide services for an aircraft, ship, MIQF or MIF, ANDwhere the employee ‘has contact with’ people who belong to different groups in the Order.","Publication Date: 12 July 2021

Self_isolation pilot to start with 150 people,"The goal of safely re-opening our borders and developing new ways for people to travel will start with a self-isolation pilot, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today.“As part of the Reconnecting New Zealanders plan announced in August, the self-isolation pilot will look at self-isolation for vaccinated travellers who have not been to very high-risk countries,” Chris Hipkins said.“The pilot is to explore a new pathway of entry into New Zealand and allows the Government to test operational readiness, identify areas where further work is required to scale up the approach and provide valuable insights into our options for the future.“Expressions of Interest are being called for up to 150 people to participate in the pilot.“The pilot is aimed at business travellers, to travel overseas on a short business trip and self-isolate in approved accommodation for 14 days on their return.“Self-isolation must be in a private dwelling with no shared ventilation system. The dwelling must have cellular coverage. Monitoring and testing over the self-isolation period will be mandatory.“Participants are required to be a New Zealand citizen or holders of a resident visa with a right to re-enter New Zealand, be fully-vaccinated in New Zealand with the Pfizer vaccine, and not travel to or through very high-risk countries. Travel must be for business purposes which cannot be carried out from New Zealand.“Participants will be selected through an Expressions of Interest (EOI) process.  Employers will need to apply on behalf of their employees and can submit their EOI from 9am, Thursday 30 September until 5pm, Saturday 9 October.“Businesses are encouraged to check the criteria carefully. As demand is expected to be higher than the numbers in the pilot, all eligible EOIs will be put into a ballot and spread across the six-week arrival timeframe.“Public safety and keeping COVID-19 out of the community still remains our top priority,” Chris Hipkins said.Notes for editors:When in self-isolation, participants must:remain in their place of self-isolation for at least 14 days. They will not be allowed to leave the property at any timeisolate alone, or together with others from the same travelling party. They cannot isolate with family or any other household members.not allow any visitors to enter the premises, aside from medical staff for testing purposes and emergency or other essential services if required (e.g. fire, ambulance, police, tradespeople for urgent repairs);provide their own food and supplies (contactless deliveries are allowed)comply with all testing requirements set out by the Ministry of Health;comply with all monitoring requirements.More information on the self-isolation pilot will be made available in the next few days:www.miq.govt.nz","Publication Date: 27 September 2021

One more day for border workers to get vaccinated_ rates already above 98_,"New Zealand’s border workers have stepped up to help protect their whānau and fellow Kiwis, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today.As of this morning over 98% of the active border workforce have received at least one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and 93% are fully vaccinated.“This greater protection at our border gives us confidence that those people who are going to work and doing their jobs, aren’t going to get sick or die from COVID-19 if we see another international ship present with the virus in our waters,or have an incursion at an airport or MIQ facility,” Chris Hipkins said.“It also reduces the possibility of transmission on to others in the community.“Over the past 10 weeks, vaccination rates for active border workers across all sectors have climbed. This is testament to the hard work of the air and maritime sectors, employers, unions, DHBs, resident experts and border workers themselves for their work in this space.”Total workers have climbed to 98% from just 84% having had one dose in July. For port workers, there has been a huge jump from just 55% in July, to 95% today.“All Government employed workers are now vaccinated, and this week’s deadline brings private employers in as well. This is a significant step towards protecting New Zealanders from COVID-19 now and into the future.“This is increasingly important as we look to how we reopen to the world. The border will continue to be our first defence against COVID-19 and the people who work there must be protected.“Anyone who has been uncertain about getting vaccinated has one more day to ask any outstanding questions and get that first dose. You will then have 35 days to get your second one following the deadline.“I encourage you to do this. It will keep you safe. I am extremely pleased and relieved this order comes into effect this week,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 29 September 2021

Number of New Zealanders fully vaccinated passes 1 million,"The COVID-19 vaccination programme has reached its most significant milestone to date, with more than 1 million people now fully vaccinated, says Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins.“Following a record day for the programme on Friday of 56,843 doses administered and a record weekend day yesterday with more than 50,000 doses delivered, today we’re celebrating another record:  one million people in New Zealand fully vaccinated,” Chris Hipkins said.“In confirming this figure, I particularly want to acknowledge the health workforce in New Zealand. They’ve stepped up across the country – and particularly in Auckland at our testing centres, vaccination clinics and hospitals – and are continuing to deliver incredible numbers which we can all be proud of.“With 2.75 million doses administered so far and 1.5 million active bookings in the Book My Vaccine system, we remain on track to give everyone eligible in Aotearoa the opportunity to be vaccinated by the end of the year.“Yesterday, around 36,500 people received their first vaccination, and more than 15,600 had their second vaccination.“On Friday, we also created a new priority group for essential workers, and since then more than 1,400 essential workers have had their first vaccination.“Thanks to everyone who has either had the vaccine or has made a booking to get vaccinated.“Your response means we’ve been able to open other age bands for vaccinations earlier than planned to keep the momentum going.“Reaching this 1 million milestone is also due to the hard work of our district health boards and primary care providers, who have continued to add to our capacity to vaccinate people each week, as well as the number of sites where people can be vaccinated.“Figures from yesterday show there are now more than 500 general practices and pharmacies administering the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the country, with more coming on stream.“By getting vaccinated, people are protecting themselves,  theirwhānauand playing their part in protecting New Zealand.”","Publication Date: 22 August 2021

Super Māori turnout for Super Saturday,"Māori have put a superb effort into mobilising to get vaccinated over Super Saturday, with thousands rolling up their sleeves to protect themselves, their whānau and communities from COVID-19, Associate Health Minister Peeni Henare says.“It was absolutely outstanding that 21,702 Māori got vaccinated on this one day alone with 10,825 people getting their first doses and 10,877 people getting fully vaccinated with their second doses. This is an awesome achievement and I want to thank everyone who took up this opportunity,” Peeni Henare said.As of 11.59pm yesterday, 375,387 Māori have had at least one dose (66 per cent of the eligible Māori population) and 252,419 (44 per cent) are fully vaccinated.“Super Saturday’s vaccination rate has shown the success of many whānau-based programmes designed and delivered by Māori, for Māori, by people who Māori communities know and trust.“Hawke’s Bay vaccinated over 6 percent of its entire eligible Māori population in a single day, which is an impressive feat and highlights the mahi that this community committed towards its Super Saturday effort.“It was great to see so many whānau attending special events and enjoying the party atmosphere of Super Saturday.“We must now build on the collective mahi being led by Māori providers and communities across Aotearoa to ensure we are protected from the virus. We have a way to go to raise the vaccine uptake rate, but I know with our collective will, and by continuing our whānau-centred approach, we can do this.“There is still a huge range of vaccination options available for Māori including pharmacies, GPs, mobile and pop-up clinics, mass vaccinations, workplace events and marae-based programmes. Drive-through vaccination sites where whānau can be vaccinated in their cars together is also providing an accessible option for many disabled whānau.“All of these initiatives are ensuring Māori can access services that meet their needs. We know this is critical to the vaccination uptake rate.“So, let’s keep this massive effort going to keep our whānau and Aotearoa safe by getting vaccinated,” Peeni Henare said.","Publication Date: 17 October 2021

Boosters and increased mask_use to prepare for Omicron,"Two thirds of New Zealanders are now eligible for their booster, as new mask requirements come in to help keep people safe, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.“If you got your second vaccination at least three months ago, you can walk-in or book-in to get your booster from today,” Chris Hipkins said.“There is plenty of capacity to get vaccinated this weekend and throughout February, wherever you are in the country.“This is the best thing you can do to protect yourselves and your whānau as we prepare for Omicron. Get boosted, and wear a mask when you can’t distance from others. We will have a much better chance of facing the virus if we are well prepared.”From 11:59pm last night (3 February) medical type masks became mandatory for those people who fall under a vaccine mandate and are in public-facing roles at work.For everyone else, masks are still mandatory on flights, public transport, in taxis, retail, public facilities, and in education for Year 4 and up. They should also now be worn at close proximity businesses, food and drink businesses, at public events and gatherings.Masks can no longer be a t-shirt, bandana or scarf. It needs to cover your mouth and nose, and attach with ear or head loops.“Ensuring you have the right mask, and that it is worn properly, will improve the overall effectiveness of wearing them and help reduce transmission of COVID-19, including Omicron,” Chris Hipkins said.“We are now looking to the next stages of our response to COVID-19 and Reconnecting New Zealanders to the world. We are preparing for the virus in our communities by putting measures in place to tackle it head on.“Our high vaccination rates and climbing booster rate is our best defence from getting very sick from the virus, while masks help us to reduce the likelihood of passing it on to others or picking it up.“These measures and continued good hygiene practices, alongside our phased plan to take on Omicron, will help keep our supply chains operating, economy ticking, people in work and kids in school.”How to get boosted:Everyone over 18 can check when they are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzor if they have one, referring to their purple COVID-19 Vaccine appointment card or calling COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).Book your booster or find a walk-in vaccination centre atbookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Whānau bookings (group bookings for more than one person) can be made by calling 0800 28 29 26.COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be available at mobile and pop-up vaccination clinics, particularly in rural Māori communities as well as marae vaccinations where a number of kaumatua received their initial doses.Interpretation services, and text, email and NZ Relay options for deaf and hearing impaired are available if you need them on 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). There is also a specialist team for disabled people (option 2 on the 0800 number).A reminder of the new mask rules:Workers who fall under a legal vaccine mandate and are in a public-facing role will be required to wear a medical-grade mask (Type IIR/Level 2 or above).Children in Year 4 and up will need to wear a mask on Ministry of Education funded school transport services and public transport, as well as in school. Teachers of students in years 4 to 13 are required to wear medical-grade masks, as above.Everyone else should wear masks in close-proximity businesses, food and drink businesses, at events and gatherings. You will still be able to remove your mask when eating and drinking.This must be an actual mask with ear or head loops that covers both the nose and mouth properly and fits against the face. That means no more scarves, bandanas, or t-shirts pulled up.Most gatherings where guests have exclusive use of a defined space won’t require guests to wear amask, such as weddings. Workers(including volunteers) will continue to be required to wear a mask.People are not required to wear masks in non-public facing workplaces, but all employers should continue to think about mask use policies that protect their workforce.Masks are also not required when using gyms or swimming pools, however it is encouraged when moving around or in close proximity to others.","Publication Date: 4 February 2022

Crown accounts show confidence in Govt economic plan,"The Government’s financial accounts continue to reflect the resilience of the economy and confidence in the Government’s economic recovery plan.The Crown accounts for the nine months to the end of March 2021 show both OBEGAL and the operating balance remain better than forecast in the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update (HYEFU) released in December last year.The operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) was $5.2 billion better than forecast in the HYEFU.Tax revenue was $69.9 billion, $4 billion above forecast due to higher than expected corporate and income tax, and GST revenue.Net core Crown debt was 33.3% of GDP, $6.6 billion less than forecast.“The economy’s robustness and confidence in the recovery has meant the Crown’s financial accounts are in better shape than expected. The Government’s vaccine rollout and careful re-opening of the borders provides further confidence as we focus on accelerating the recovery,” Grant Robertson said.“Our resilience, however, will continue to be tested. The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on India is a painful reminder that we are still in a volatile and uncertain global economic environment. Supply chain issues affect the economy. Some sectors and regions in New Zealand remain under pressure.“While these results are strong, we do need to remember that we are still facing elevated levels of debt and OBEGAL deficits for some years to come as a result of the borrowing needed to support New Zealanders through COVID 19.“Budget 2021 will reflect the economic conditions and revenue situation and take a balanced approach that continues to emphasise spending to areas and people where it is needed most alongside careful fiscal management.“We have used our strong balance sheet in response to COVID and will continue to invest to meet our three priorities of keeping New Zealanders safe, accelerating the recovery and address long standing issues of climate change, housing affordability and child wellbeing. We will do all this while working towards reducing our debt levels,” Grant Robertson said.","Publication Date: 6 May 2021

New text service to support disabled peoples_ vaccinations,"Efforts to support disabled peoples’ vaccinations go from strength-to-strength with the launch of a new text service, Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni announced today.The service, run by Whakarongorau Aotearoa on behalf of the Ministry of Health, is in response to feedback from the disability community and is an addition to the COVID Vaccination Healthline, which already offers dedicated phone and email support for disabled people and people living with impairments to get their COVID-19 vaccination.“We’re making it easier for the deaf, hard of hearing community and others who may be speech impaired to get vaccinated. They can now text 8988 for access to vaccine information, help to book a vaccination appointment, or support with transport,” Carmel Sepuloni said.“It’s heartening to see good uptake of the phone and email service which has already received over 3,400 phone calls since September. It has not only been a safe haven for disabled people to discuss the vaccination, anxiety or needle phobias, but they’ve been supported to access sites with low sensory settings for example as well as home vaccinations.“The Whakarongorau service is staffed with a dedicated team of advisors who are either living with a disability themselves, have close whānau with a disability or, have extensive experience working with the disabled community. Their lived experience makes the service unique and underlines the ethos of The Manaakitanga Journey to enhancing the vaccination experiences for disabled people.“One in four New Zealanders identify as disabled or having an impairment. As of the 21st of November, of the 37,269 people supported by Disability Support Services and long term ACC clients nationwide, 86 percent have had their first dose, and 79 percent have been fully vaccinated.“As we take steps towards more freedoms as a fully vaccinated Aotearoa NZ, we’re committed to ensuring that our vaccination programme continues to be as accessible and inclusive as possible to all New Zealanders.“We’re in a new phase in our fight against COVID, and an even greater fight to protect the hauora of disabled people and their whānau,” Carmel Sepuloni said.To contact Whakarongau Healthline:call the COVID Vaccination Healthline Team on 0800 28 29 26 and ‘push 2.’use the new free text option - text 8988email the team ataccessiblecovidvaccinations@whakarongorau.nzThe Disability COVID Vaccination Healthline team is available between 8 am and 8 pm Monday to Friday.Healthline can book transport and other accommodations via Healthline.Alternatively, disabled people can use the NZ Relay Service to contact Health Line, which offers services for Deaf, hard of hearing, speech impaired and deafblind people via:www.nzrelay.co.nzthe NZ Relay Appthe help desk is open 24/7 and can be reached viaTTY: 0800 4 713 713Voice: 0800 4 715 715Fax 0800 4 329 697 oremailhelpdesk@nzrelay.co.nz","Publication Date: 25 November 2021

Joint statement_ Prime Ministers Jacinda Ardern and Scott Morrison,"Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern and Prime Minister the Hon Scott Morrison MP met in Queenstown on 31 May 2021 for the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ Meeting.1. The Australia-New Zealand relationship is unique in its closeness; we are partners and allies, and we share a relationship of family, of whānau. Through our single economic market, our people-to-people ties and our shared interests in the region and the world, Australia and New Zealand stand together.2. The Prime Ministers began by acknowledging the unique role of Australia’s and New Zealand’s Indigenous peoples in the identity of both countries, including their rich cultures and languages, and their ancestral, spiritual and continuing connections to land, water and community.COVID-19 response and recovery3. The Prime Ministers were pleased to have their first in-person meeting since February last year, made possible by two-way quarantine-free travel across the Tasman.4. They welcomed close trans-Tasman cooperation in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and noted that quarantine-free travel was a reflection of how hard both countries have worked to manage COVID-19. They acknowledged the toll on those in both countries who had lost loved ones, and all those who had suffered economically. They expressed condolences to countries which had experienced a far greater impact, including those battling second, third or fourth waves.5. The Prime Ministers acknowledged trans-Tasman collaboration to support early COVID-19 vaccine development and purchase, including the ACT Accelerator and the COVAX Facility. They acknowledged the valuable contribution of COVAX in ensuring equitable access to vaccines, globally. They agreed to continue cooperation on vaccines, including research and development. The Prime Ministers undertook to support efforts to ensure the free international movement of medical goods, including vaccines and vaccine components.6. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed that together Australia and New Zealand will provide safe and effective vaccines to ensure comprehensive vaccine coverage for our Pacific family and Timor-Leste at the earliest opportunity. This complements COVAX vaccines, and doses delivered by the US and France.7. The Prime Ministers also confirmed New Zealand and Australia will continue to use a variety of mechanisms to securing and delivering vaccines, including through direct support and bilateral donations to COVAX, bilateral donations to individual countries, and working through multilateral agencies such as UNICEF. Australia and New Zealand are not just providing doses, but also wrap-around support including medical supplies, consumables and support for planning, training, communications and cold storage. Australia and New Zealand will constantly work with partners in the region to reassess needs as circumstances change.8. The Prime Ministers discussed plans for reconnecting our region with the rest of the world, and welcomed continued close coordination given the linked trans-Tasman border. They noted opportunities to collaborate on initiatives to extend travel options for Pacific neighbours when safe to do so, including through the trans-Tasman quarantine-free travel zone. This reflects our close ties to the Pacific and our commitment to supporting their recovery. Leaders also tasked officials to explore technological solutions to verify vaccination status to enable Australians and New Zealanders to reconnect with the wider world,alongside other technological solutions that support a safe reopening, while maintaining the trans-Tasman travel arrangements. Leaders expressed their desire to, as much as possible, write the reopening rulebook together.Pacific9. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the severe economic hardship the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for many countries in the Pacific, with tourism sectors particularly affected. They committed to continuing work already underway with Pacific governments, the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and other partners to support Pacific economies, helping affected communities and businesses. They agreed to continue advocacy with other partners for increased assistance to the region.10. The Prime Ministers recognised a unified Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) provides the best mechanism for our Pacific family to have a strong international voice, and achieve outcomes on priority regional challenges. They expressed hope that the Pacific Islands Forum Troika Plus political dialogue would identify solutions for the benefit of all PIF Members.11. The Prime Ministers welcomed the deep and continuing partnership between Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island partners to address regional security issues including climate change, transnational organised crime, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing, cyber-security and cyber-crime, and corruption.12. The Prime Ministers welcomed the entry into force of the PACER Plus Trade and Development Agreement, under which Pacific island countries will benefit from increased economic activity encouraged by customs modernisation, harmonisation and a Development and Economic Cooperation work programme supported by a dedicated implementation unit. The Prime Ministers look forward to all Signatories to the Agreement ratifying and more Pacific island countries joining the agreement in order to realise its benefits of enhanced economic integration and inclusive growth.Trans-Tasman cooperation13. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed the importance of ongoing work under the Single Economic Market agenda to promote policy and regulatory coherence, and to support economic recovery. They acknowledged that the established trans-Tasman architecture had facilitated cooperation in response to COVID-19, including on two-way quarantine-free travel.14. Recognising the role of the digital economy as an enabler for all areas of the SEM agenda, the Prime Ministers welcomed agreement on a roadmap for mutual recognition of digital identity. They instructed officials to continue work towards interoperability on improving government services, payment practices policies, and the Consumer Data Right.15. The Prime Ministers welcomed continuing bilateral collaboration towards a responsible approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. They welcomed the ongoing joint implementation of the Trans-Tasman Cyber Security Research Programme and its projects.  They also supported bilateral and multilateral engagement on standards setting for critical and emerging technologies.16. The Prime Ministers agreed on the value of policy alignment on a circular economy and directed officials to work together on issues such as data collection on waste and material flows; sharing lessons on respective waste strategies; cooperation on marine plastics; and increasing capacity of onshore processing, which will have added benefits for Pacific Island countries given our shared role as recycling and waste management hubs for the region.17. The Prime Ministers instructed officials to establish a Supply Chain Dialogue, building on our respective existing and planned freight and supply chain strategies, to share experiences and seek opportunities for collaboration. They asked officials to share best practices for identifying and managing supply chain disruption risks and use this to drive information sharing and tangible joint action. They agreed addressing non‑tariff barriers will support supply chain resilience and committed to improving trans-Tasman regulatory coherence and resilience in the freight, transport and health sectors. They asked officials to explore opportunities to harness innovations from the pandemic response, and advance digital trade.18. Prime Ministers welcomed work between border agencies to deliver a more seamless border for traders that manages risk while also facilitating imports and exports across our economies. They directed officials to continue work on a secure trade lane between Australia and New Zealand for low risk cargo, and on improving processes for border clearances, including through enhanced use of data and technology.19. The Prime Ministers encouraged officials to ensure our countries maintain strong biosecurity by harnessing technological developments, building on close bilateral cooperation on world-leading biosecurity risk auto-detection algorithms and 3D x-ray technology. They agreed to trial use of this technology through our respective biosecurity screening approaches, commencing with pre-screening of baggage and air cargo on commercial passenger services.20. The Prime Ministers recognised the importance of the Joint Food Standards System, underpinned by the Joint Food Standards System Agreement and supported by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Prime Ministers directed officials to continue work on how the System can be maintained and improved.21. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to mental health initiatives that provide best practice in mental health support in emergency response and recovery. They welcomed Australia’s announcement of a $2.3 billion investment in mental health support and treatment and New Zealand’s $1.9 billion investment in a programme of cross-government initiatives, and new services, to transform its mental health and addiction system.22. The Prime Ministers welcomed the passage of legislative amendments in Australia and New Zealand to enable New Zealanders to transfer unclaimed retirement savings in Australia into their KiwiSaver accounts. They instructed officials to update the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement to facilitate these transfers.23. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed Australia and New Zealand’s growing focus on economic development opportunities, jobs and growth in the Indigenous business sector. They reflected on the success of the Virtual Indigenous Trade and Connections Event, and encouraged officials to continue to share policy experiences and data to support indigenous development, such as New Zealand’s recently announced policies and targets for government procurement with Māori businesses in Aotearoa and Australia’s Indigenous Procurement Policy. The Prime Ministers look forward to future trans-Tasman trade and policy missions between our Indigenous Peoples (as border restrictions allow), as well as ongoing partnership on the New Zealand-led Te Aratini Global Indigenous Symposium at Expo 2020 Dubai.24. The Prime Ministers acknowledged continued science, research and innovation cooperation under the Australia-New Zealand Science, Research and Innovation Cooperation Agreement. They welcomed progress on the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SouthPAN) joint program, scheduled to be fully certified and operational by 2025. They also welcomed continuation of the Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Dialogue, establishment of an Indigenous STEM Dialogue, and further work towards the development of a Trans-Tasman Innovation Ecosystem.People-to-people ties25. The Prime Ministers welcomed the return of whānau/family members, business travellers and tourists moving in both directions across the Tasman. Quarantine-free travel has reunited friends and family and provided a boost to the economic recovery in both countries, as well as enabling a resumption of face-to-face meetings between the Prime Ministers, Ministers and officials.26. The Prime Ministers re-affirmed the value of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, which provides for an exceptionally high degree of freedom of movement between the two countries. They acknowledged the support each country had provided to the other’s citizens during COVID-19, including allowing those ordinarily resident in the other country to return home, and their inclusion of each other’s citizens in respective COVID-19 wage subsidy programs.27. The Prime Ministers were pleased to confirm a change to the unique pathway to citizenship for New Zealanders living and working in Australia. From 1 July 2021, Australia will reduce the number of years in which applicants for the New Zealand stream of the Skilled Independent (subclass 189) permanent residence visa must reach the minimum income threshold (from four years to three). Prime Ministers also welcomed Australia’s flexibility for applicants whose income or time offshore was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and looked forward to a further review of the pathway visa in 2022.28. The Prime Ministers celebrated the successful bid for New Zealand and Australia to co‑host the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, one of the largest sporting events on the planet. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the opportunity to use the event to achieve lasting social impact through sport for women and girls across our Indo-Pacific region.Climate change and the environment29. The Prime Ministers agreed on the importance of ambitious and practical action in pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. They agreed to sustain close and valuable cooperation on climate change, including in the Pacific and on agricultural emissions.

The Prime Ministers acknowledged the strong link between climate change, oceans, and biodiversity.30. The Prime Ministers recognised the importance of protecting the ocean, including coral reef ecosystems, to build resilience and address biodiversity loss, along with tackling the growing problem of marine plastic pollution.31. The Prime Ministers recognised that climate change remains one of the most significant long-term security and development issues facing the Pacific region. New Zealand and Australia will ensure their support for the Pacific’s COVID-19 response and recovery aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement and helps build climate and disaster resilience.32. The Prime Ministers agreed to continue working closely with the Pacific to establish maritime zones and promote the preservation of these zones in the face of climate change-related sea-level rise. The Prime Ministers recognised fisheries will be a critical plank of the Pacific region’s economic recovery from COVID-19, and reaffirmed their commitment to the sustainability of the region’s fisheries and continuing to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing.33. The Prime Ministers emphasised the need for pragmatic solutions to address marine litter and other waste issues, and directed officials to incorporate these into their collaboration towards a circular economy. The Prime Ministers looked forward to the adoption of an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming in October 2021.Global trade34. The Prime Ministers reiterated their support for the multilateral trading system, and the importance of a well-functioning World Trade Organization (WTO) in promoting sustainable global economic growth and prosperity, including as part of the COVID-19 recovery.35. The Prime Ministers welcomed the election of WTO Director-General Okonjo-Iweala. They recommitted to working closely together, and with APEC partners, to deliver ambitious multilateral disciplines on fisheries subsidies by July, and a successful WTO 12th Ministerial Conference that delivers concrete outcomes and a pathway for meaningful reform. They emphasised the need for the WTO to be responsive to the pandemic through outcomes on trade and health, and welcomed joint efforts to strengthen disciplines to reduce trade- and production-distorting agriculture subsidies. The Prime Ministers also reiterated the importance of a functioning Appellate Body and welcomed plurilateral progress in services domestic regulation, and e-commerce negotiations.36. The two Prime Ministers agreed on APEC’s important role in driving the Asia-Pacific region’s return to economic prosperity.

This includes the immediate need to remove barriers to trade in vaccines and medical supplies in the region.37. The Prime Ministers affirmed their strong support for open rules-based trade that is based on market principles. They expressed concern over harmful economic coercion and agreed to work with partners to tackle security and economic challenges.Indo-Pacific and Global security38.

New Zealand_s first COVID_19 vaccine to arrive earlier than expected,"New Zealand’s first batch of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is set to arrive in New Zealand next week subject to transportation plans and quality temperature control, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.“We have been working behind the scenes to secure the timely arrival of vaccines for our border workers and their families and it’s great they will arrive well within our scheduled timeframes,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Government representatives have been in conversations with Pfizer on a constant basis for the last few weeks. We appreciate the effort the company has gone to to deliver the first instalment earlier than originally anticipated.“Last year we indicated the vaccine would arrive in quarter two, and earlier this year we updated that to quarter one. It’s pleasing to be receiving doses this early in quarter one.“The arrival of our first batch of doses is an important milestone in our fight against COVID-19. We now anticipate further deliveries through quarter one from Pfizer.“Our first priority is our border workers, who we expect to vaccinate within two to three weeks followed by their household contacts. Health care and essential workers and those most at risk from COVID-19 will follow in quarter two, before vaccination of the wider population in the second half of the year,” Jacinda Ardern said.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the first vaccinations to border workers were on track to be administered in the same week as the vaccine’s arrival in New Zealand. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses and must be stored at -70 degrees centigrade.“Systems and processes are in place for the first vaccinations to start once final checks have been completed,” Chris Hipkins said.“On arrival, the vaccine must be independently tested for quality assurance, which is another important safety check. The doses will then be formally released to start the first phase of the vaccination programme.“At this stage, we are expecting to start offering the vaccine to our border and MIQ workers on 20th February, with the first immunisations given out to those working in the Auckland region,” Chris Hipkins said.","Publication Date: 12 February 2021

PM Ardern chairs APEC Leaders_ meeting on COVID_19,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has chaired a meeting of Leaders representing the 21 APEC economies overnight.“For the first time in APEC’s history Leaders have come together for an extraordinary meeting focused exclusively on COVID-19, and how our region can navigate out of the worst health and economic crisis in living memory,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Front of mind for leaders is achieving widespread access for vaccines globally and working collaboratively to provide them to everyone as soon as possible.“Our discussions moved us beyond vaccine nationalism. Now we are focusing on all aspects of contributing to the global vaccination effort – making vaccines, sharing vaccines and using vaccines.“Nobody is safe from this virus until everyone is safe. Ensuring both global vaccine access and uptake is as high as possible in the shortest time possible gives our regional and individual economies the greatest chance to accelerate recovery, and will support greater economic stability.“We are also pushing for collaborative and practical solutions on safely reconnecting with the world by continuing to explore options including vaccine passports, travel green lanes and quarantine-free travel bubbles. This is a challenge to which we are working hard to find creative solutions.“We have the opportunity to build back better and emerge from this crisis more inclusive, more sustainable and more adaptable than ever, and in order to achieve this as fast as possible - we need to do it together,” Jacinda Ardern said.Leaders also discussed a range of other matters relating to the pandemic including:Individual domestic approaches to the ongoing management of COVID-19;The evolving strains and health dimensions of COVID-19, with APEC helping speed the flow of vaccines;Fiscal and monetary tools available to sustain economies through the pandemic, with the importance of keeping markets open to one another.Leading a regional health, trade and economic response to the pandemic has been one of New Zealand’s priorities as APEC 2021 Chair. Today’s meeting builds on progress made at APEC Trade, Structural Reform and Finance Ministers’ meetings from last month and sets a strong foundation for when APEC Leaders meet again in November.“Leaders have set strong expectations of the outcomes we want in November to support the COVID-19 recovery. These include making sure that APEC economies have lowered tariffs on vaccines moving across borders, and that economies have accelerated digitalisation of border paperwork, reducing costs on businesses,” Jacinda Ardern said.","Publication Date: 17 July 2021

Additional Pfizer COVID_19 vaccines purchased,"The government has signed a purchase agreement with Pfizer for 4.7 million additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for delivery in 2022, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.“This purchase agreement will ensure that we have a continual supply of Pfizer vaccines throughout next year,” Chris Hipkins said.“These vaccines will be provided to those who didn’t access a vaccine in 2021, for example those turning 12 next year, be used if the eligibility is extended to younger age groups, and for a potential booster programme if the evidence determines this is required and if Medsafe grants approval.“New Zealand is also committed to supporting our Pacific neighbours with their COVID-19 response, including vaccine supply.”New Zealand has access to a total of 10.88 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in 2021. The additional agreement for 4.7 million doses will be delivered throughout 2022.“These doses will complement the other COVID-19 vaccines in our portfolio, which are scheduled for delivery in 2022. Further announcements on use of these vaccines will be made in due course,” Chris Hipkins said.“The Pfizer vaccine is being rolled out right across New Zealand, including to our hard to reach and rural areas. We are continuing to focus on reaching at least 90% vaccination rates across all DHBs.“We have the ability to deliver vaccines right across Aotearoa New Zealand, quickly and efficiently, and there is enough vaccines right now for every eligible person to be fully vaccinated.”","Publication Date: 3 November 2021

COVID_19 vaccine progress encouraging,"News today from Pfizer and BioNTech that they have had promising results from COVID-19 clinical trials of a vaccine is encouraging, Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods said.In October, the Government signed an agreement to purchase 1.5 million COVID-19 vaccines – enough for 750,000 people – from Pfizer and BioNTech, subject to the vaccine successfully completing all clinical trials and passing regulatory approvals in New Zealand.“As part of the agreement, vaccine delivery to New Zealand could be as early as the first quarter of 2021. Provided the vaccine is approved for use in New Zealand by Medsafe, it is possible that some doses will be available to us in the first part of 2021,” Megan Woods said.“Medsafe is working to optimise its processes so that any promising vaccines will be fully assessed as quickly as possible against the same criteria used for all other medicines that enter New Zealand.“Pfizer and BioNTech will keep us up to date as to when data will be available for Medsafe to begin its evaluation process,” Megan Woods said.Megan Woods said the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Taskforce, led by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, is currently negotiating with other pharmaceutical companies, and further announcements are expected in November.“The agreement with Pfizer and BioNTech is one of a number of negotiations underway as part of our portfolio approach, and good progress is being made in relation to other purchasing negotiations. The additional agreements will ensure that once the portfolio is completed, we will have sufficient COVID-19 vaccines for the whole population,” Megan Woods said.The Ministry of Health is developing a sequencing framework to guide the rollout of the vaccines as they become available.The Ministry of Health is preparing for a range of vaccine scenarios and will finalise the expected vaccination approach once the features of a vaccine and the supply that will initially be available are known. However, three broad groups are being considered:·                     Those at risk of spreading COVID-19·                     Those at risk of contracting COVID-19·                     Those at risk of increased morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.“Ensuring equity of outcomes is a key measure of success, including protection for Māori, Pacific peoples and our most vulnerable population groups, such as older people, disabled people, health workers, essential workers and border staff. The Government has set aside $66.3 million for medical supplies and infrastructure to ensure New Zealand is ready to launch a COVID-19 Immunisation Programme as soon as we have a safe and effective vaccine,”  Megan Woods said.","Publication Date: 10 November 2020

Aotearoa hits 90 percent fully vaccinated milestone,"Give yourselves a pat on the back, New Zealand.“We’ve now reached 90 percent fully vaccinated across the country – that means 3,788,151 New Zealanders have rolled up their sleeves to protect themselves, their whānau, friends and communities,” COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said.“We knew yesterday we’d reached the milestone, and now that the official count is through, we can formally recognise the hard work of everyone who has played their part, and who are continuing to do their bit.“Their commitment means all New Zealanders are safer and more protected, and can get back to doing the things they love, whether it’s travelling to catch up with friends and family for Christmas, heading out to restaurants, pubs and cafes, or enjoying the many festivals and outdoor events planned for the summer.“This tremendous result could not have happened without the efforts of the many thousands of people across Aotearoa who’ve worked tirelessly since the vaccination programme was launched early this year to support the goal of getting every eligible New Zealander vaccinated.“This includes our more than 15,000 vaccinators, as well as our DHB health teams, Māori and Pacific health providers, community NGOs, Government ministries and agencies, logistics, delivery and distribution centre staff, and the countless others who’ve been such an instrumental part of the programme’s success to date.“Thisresult also comes hot on the heels of the three DHBs in the Auckland metropolitan area having now hit the 90% fully vaccinated milestone. That means seven DHBs in total have now nailed this mark, with a number of others about to reach it in the coming days.“And the work continues. By 11.59pm last night, 3,789,662 of the 4,209,057 eligible New Zealanders aged 12 and over were fully vaccinated, with 3,969,267 (or 94%) partially vaccinated.“We know we still have more to do, and we will be continuing the mahi to further raise vaccination rates in those areas where it’s most needed – as well as among our Māori and Pacific communities to bring them closer to that 90 per cent fully vaccinated mark.“That’s why I encourage everyone in Aotearoa who is eligible for the vaccine to go ahead and get their shot, whether it be their first, second or a booster dose.“There are hundreds of places open until Christmas and over the summer holidays where you can get your vaccination, so it’s never been easier.“There’s also a ton of really good information available from official, trusted sources, which is a good place to start for anyone who still has questions.“This includes the key websites -www.covid19.govt.nz,www.health.govt.nz,www.karawhiua.nz,www.mpp.govt.nz, or your health provider. Healthline is another great place to have your questions answered – call 0800 28 29 26.“We want all of our communities protected against COVID-19, and no-one who’s eligible to be left behind.”","Publication Date: 16 December 2021

Govt books solid as global situation worsens,"The Crown accounts are in a solid position thanks to the Government’s careful financial management through a deteriorating global environment.For the four months to the end of October, the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) recorded a deficit of $2.8 billion, $274 million lower than forecast at Budget 2022 in May and $5 billion lower than for the same period a year ago. Tax revenue also came in slightly below expectations.“The economy is continuing to show its resilience even as global economic storm clouds gather. The sobering reality is global growth is slowing and New Zealand will not escape its impact, with forecasts of a shallow recession next year,” Grant Robertson said.“Government actions to grow the economy and support Kiwis means New Zealand is well-positioned to face these global challenges with a solid balance sheet, near record low unemployment, more people in paid work and wages increasing.“We know that Kiwis are finding it tough as they face cost of living pressures and rising interest rates. The Government is doing its bit to soften the impact, including through the recently announced childcare package.“New forecasts out today show food and fibre export revenue are projected to reach new record highs of $55 billion in the coming year, in part a result of the six new trade agreements and upgrades the Government has secured since 2017. In addition to growing our exports, tourists are returning in greater numbers which will all go some way to help protect New Zealanders from the sharp edges of the global downturn.“The deteriorating global situation will flow through to the Government’s books. The Treasury’s Half year Fiscal and Economic Update on 14 December will provide more detail onits likely impact on New Zealand, but the direction of travel is clear.“It is important that we continue to carefully and responsibly manage our finances. Government spending as a percentage of GDP is expected to fall over the forecast period and contribute less each year to overall domestic demand. Tough choices, however, will be required on the pathway back to surplus.”Core Crown tax revenue was $62 million below forecast at $36.2 billion, due to lower-than-expected GST returns and lower Fuel Excise Duties and Road Users Charges, which were cut to support New Zealanders with cost of living pressures.Core Crown expenses were $515 million above forecast at $41.8 billion, due to higher interest costs and health expenses, including the timing of vaccine charges that occurred during this period.Net debt stood at 19.5 percent of GDP, which was above forecast mainly due to market conditions affecting the New Zealand Super Fund’s financial portfolio. Using the old measure, net core Crown debt was below forecast at 39.4 percent of GDP compared with projections of 40.4 percent of GDP.“Our debt levels are among the lowest in the OECD and well below the Government’s debt ceiling of 30 percent, ensuring we are well positioned to weather further economic shocks,” Grant Robertson said.“In these highly uncertain global economic times, we continue to take a balanced approach that has worked for New Zealand. We remain focused on prioritising our spending without adding to inflation pressures and returning to surplus in 2024/25, which would be a year earlier than the National Government did after the Global Financial Crisis.”","Publication Date: 1 December 2022

Govt expands mental health,"More families will have access to online parenting and family support programmes in response to the continued disruption caused by COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, Health Minister Andrew Little says.“The Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) series of programmes offer practical advice, easy-to-use resources and strategies for parents to help their children and teens cope with life’s ups and downs.“Just as the vaccine programme has been key, supporting mental wellbeing has also been a vital part of this Government’s response to COVID-19.”“We know that this pandemic has been particularly tough on young people and for some, the return to school after an extended break may add to the stress. These programmes will help parents better support their children to be more resilient,” Andrew Little said.The programmes were made available to parents during last year’s Delta lockdown in Auckland with very positive feedback, and from this week will be available to parents anywhere in the country.“We know COVID-19 has caused stress for many families with worries about money, work and schooling. While these issues are separate, all of them can affect mental health. This is about supporting parents and children to manage their wellbeing over the long term,” Andrew Little said.“We know by investing early in psychosocial supports, some of the personal effects of COVID-19 can be minimised, and long-term mental wellbeing can be better supported,” Andrew Little said.The programmes are funded as part of the Government’s $5.6 million psychosocial package announced in November.The available Triple P suite of online programmes include –Triple P Online,Teen Triple P Online, andFear-Less Triple P Online.Triple P’s online courses, including thefree guide to parenting during COVID-19, can be found atwww.triplep-parenting.net.nzENDSNotes:What we have achieved since Budget ‘19As of 30 November 2021 - The Access and Choice programme:The Budget 19 Access and Choice Programme has four work streams: Youth, Māori, Pacific, Integrated Primary Mental Health and Addiction services (IPMHA)Over 300 GP sites delivering Integrated Primary Mental Health and Addiction services across New Zealand.

Major milestones for Māori COVID_19 vaccine rollout as new campaign launches,"Whānau Ora and Associate Health (Māori Health) Minister Peeni Henare acknowledges two major milestones in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme forMāori.“I am very pleased to announcemore than 50 percent of eligible Māorihave received their first dose and 25 per cent are now fully vaccinated,” Peeni Henare said.“Thismeans over285,000 of eligible Māori have had their first dose. This is fantastic news and demonstrates that the whānau-based approach we have taken across the roll-out is working.“The success of vaccination rates increasing in our Māori communities is due to the mahi being led by ourMāori Health Providers and Whānau Ora Provider Network. They are leading a whānau-centred approach, providing outreach in hard-to-reach communities and taking the extra step to ensure the needs of our whānau are met.“I want to mihi to all the kaimahi across the motu who are working hard to support our whānau. Thank you so much for all you’ve done and continue to do for our people.“I acknowledge our three leading district health boards in first dose vaccinations: Southern, 58.7%, Capital and Coast, 58.4% and Tāmaki Makaurau, 52.8%.“Māori Health Providers are rolling out many different approaches available to whānau across the motu.“But there is still more mahi to be done. That is why I am proud to support the work the Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency and Te Whānau o Waipareira’s Fight for your whakapapa campaign launching today.“Te Whānau o Waipareira have led an innovative whānau-first vaccination response in Tāmaki Makaurau despite the challenges of the Alert Level 4 lockdown. They quickly set up drive-through vaccinations and allowed walk-ins to enable whānau to come at times convenient to them, and now are leading the rollout of the ‘Shot Bro’ bus across hard-to-reach communities”“Starting Monday the 08004MAORI phone line will operate 7 days a week between 8am-8pm, while also using popular Auckland radio stations and social media platforms to keep whānau updated on where the mobile vaccination bus will be in the community.“From the start of the vaccination rollout I have said that this is about protecting our whānau and our whakapapa but this is not a one size fits all approach.“There is currently a range of vaccination options available forMāoriincluding walk in vaccination centres, pharmacies, GPs, mobile and pop-up clinics, mass vaccinations, workplace events, drive-through centres and marae-based programmes.“Everyone is playing their part in the push to get all Māorivaccinated, including Turanga Health who are providing local Māori vaccination training and the Southern District Health Board which is working with Māori health providers to vaccinate shearing gangs in rural and remote areas across the district.“We’ve had Māori wardens in Kaikoura helping with the vaccine rollout to their Māori population over 75, resulting in a 100 percent vaccination rate for this population; Ngāti Hine Health Trust opening a vaccination centre in Whangārei; Northland iwi opening a mobile vaccination service; a community vaccination centre has opened in Tokoroa; Muriwhenua kura are leading door-to-door vaccination drives in the Far North, and targeted Māori vaccination centres in Taranaki are boosting vaccination rates. These are but a few initiatives being driven by Māori for Māori.“I want to give a special shout-out to Natasha Kemp, Chief Executive of Manurewa Marae, who initiated a walk-in service for rangatahi Māori that has seen an increase in vaccination uptake as a result.“All of these initiatives are proving a huge success and ensure that Māorican access culturally safe services that meet their needs. We know this is critical to boosting the vaccination uptake rate and ensuring equitable outcomes for Māori.“While these figures are cause for celebration, we cannot afford to become complacent. It is vitally important thatMāoricontinue to get themselves vaccinated not just for themselves, but for their kaumatua, their tamariki, and their communities.“My number one message is come forward, get vaccinated. Once you are vaccinated, this helps make sure that you and your friends and whānau have the best protection against COVID-19,” Peeni Henare said.For live updates on Vaccination Campaignhttps://www.facebook.com/waiwhanauhttps://vax.waipareira.comhttps://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-vaccine-data","Publication Date: 19 September 2021
