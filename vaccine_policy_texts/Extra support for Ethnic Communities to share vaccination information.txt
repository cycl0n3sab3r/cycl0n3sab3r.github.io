Extra support is being made available to Ethnic Communities to help them share COVID-19 vaccination information within their communities, Minister for Diversity, Inclusion and Ethnic Communities Priyanca Radhakrishnan said. “We know we need to get every eligible person in New Zealand vaccinated. A fund being launched today will allow for more targeted support to ensure that even those in harder-to-reach communities can access accurate information about vaccinations, ” Priyanca Radhakrishnan said. “The funding will enable community organisations to share materials widely and to proactively reach out to members of their communities who rely on these groups and leaders for information. ”The fund will complement the wider government COVID-19 vaccination communications and engagement campaign, which engages with ethnic communities and provides information in multiple languages and through ethnic media platforms. “New Zealand is a diverse country with over 213 ethnic communities represented who collectively speak over 160 languages, have varied needs, and may access information differently. “Community organisations know how to reach members of their community and play a vital role in encouraging their members to get vaccinated. This fund will give them the resources to reach more people. “We continue to work in partnership with ethnic community organisations to collectively do everything in our power to eliminate the COVID-19 virus, ” Priyanca Radhakrishnan said. The fund is provided by the Ministry of Health and has been set up in partnership with the Ministry for Ethnic Communities. It will make $1 million available. Ethnic community organisations will be able to apply for funding to support initiatives that increase communication and engagement.
