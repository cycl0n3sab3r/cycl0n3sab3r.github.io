"New Zealand’s first batch of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is set to arrive in New Zealand next week subject to transportation plans and quality temperature control, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.“We have been working behind the scenes to secure the timely arrival of vaccines for our border workers and their families and it’s great they will arrive well within our scheduled timeframes,” Jacinda Ardern said.“Government representatives have been in conversations with Pfizer on a constant basis for the last few weeks.",Long Sentence
"We appreciate the effort the company has gone to to deliver the first instalment earlier than originally anticipated.“Last year we indicated the vaccine would arrive in quarter two, and earlier this year we updated that to quarter one.",Long Sentence
It’s pleasing to be receiving doses this early in quarter one.“The arrival of our first batch of doses is an important milestone in our fight against COVID-19.,Long Sentence
"We now anticipate further deliveries through quarter one from Pfizer.“Our first priority is our border workers, who we expect to vaccinate within two to three weeks followed by their household contacts.",Long Sentence
"Health care and essential workers and those most at risk from COVID-19 will follow in quarter two, before vaccination of the wider population in the second half of the year,” Jacinda Ardern said.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the first vaccinations to border workers were on track to be administered in the same week as the vaccine’s arrival in New Zealand.",Long Sentence
"The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses and must be stored at -70 degrees centigrade.“Systems and processes are in place for the first vaccinations to start once final checks have been completed,” Chris Hipkins said.“On arrival, the vaccine must be independently tested for quality assurance, which is another important safety check.",Long Sentence
"The doses will then be formally released to start the first phase of the vaccination programme.“At this stage, we are expecting to start offering the vaccine to our border and MIQ workers on 20th February, with the first immunisations given out to those working in the Auckland region,” Chris Hipkins said.",Long Sentence
