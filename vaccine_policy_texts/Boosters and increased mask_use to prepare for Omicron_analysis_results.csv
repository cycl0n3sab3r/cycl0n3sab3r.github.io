"We will have a much better chance of facing the virus if we are well prepared.”From 11:59pm last night (3 February) medical type masks became mandatory for those people who fall under a vaccine mandate and are in public-facing roles at work.For everyone else, masks are still mandatory on flights, public transport, in taxis, retail, public facilities, and in education for Year 4 and up.",Long Sentence

"It needs to cover your mouth and nose, and attach with ear or head loops.“Ensuring you have the right mask, and that it is worn properly, will improve the overall effectiveness of wearing them and help reduce transmission of COVID-19, including Omicron,” Chris Hipkins said.“We are now looking to the next stages of our response to COVID-19 and Reconnecting New Zealanders to the world.",Long Sentence
"We are preparing for the virus in our communities by putting measures in place to tackle it head on.“Our high vaccination rates and climbing booster rate is our best defence from getting very sick from the virus, while masks help us to reduce the likelihood of passing it on to others or picking it up.“These measures and continued good hygiene practices, alongside our phased plan to take on Omicron, will help keep our supply chains operating, economy ticking, people in work and kids in school.”How to get boosted:Everyone over 18 can check when they are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzor if they have one, referring to their purple COVID-19 Vaccine appointment card or calling COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).Book your booster or find a walk-in vaccination centre atbookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week).",Long Sentence
