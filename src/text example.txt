No one is safe from the virus until everyone is safe from it, so it is in all our interest to remove any blocks to access and distribution of the vaccine, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cNew Zealand supports the waiver of IP protections on vaccines as an important part of our collective efforts to address the human catastrophe of the pandemic. \u201cThe Government has been actively engaged in discussions at the WTO on the TRIPS waiver and we welcome the US announcement and look forward to taking this forward with urgency. \u201cIn addition to removing barriers to speedy access to the vaccine via the WTO, New\u00a0Zealand continues to strongly support the COVAX Facility, which is playing a critical role to ensure vaccines reach all corners of the globe. \u201cNew\u00a0Zealand has contributed $17 million in Official Development Assistance to support these efforts, and is sharing 1.668 million vaccine doses (sufficient for over 800,000 people) to COVAX for distribution to developing countries. This is in addition to our direct support for vaccine access for Pacific Island countries. \u201cWe are also working in APEC, the WTO and other fora to address other elements of vaccine supply issues including through the supply chains that are limiting the availability of vaccines regionally and globally. \u201cThis includes our collective and urgent need to address tariff barriers, regulatory restrictions, export restrictions and enable trade facilitation measures that could facilitate swift access to vaccines and their effective distribution. \u00a0 We also need to do all we can to increase the manufacture, distribution and availability of vaccines. \u201cIn less than a month, on 5 June, I will chair a meeting of all 21 APEC trade ministers. I want our region to send a united message to the world that we must get all our people vaccinated as fast as possible and that trade must be a part of the solution to avoid more human suffering and economic pain, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said.",

The shipment of 150,000 doses touched down late yesterday afternoon. The vaccines were taken straight from the tarmac at Auckland Airport to the storage and distribution centre, where quality checks were carried out to ensure ultra-low temperatures were maintained during the flight and that none of the vials were damaged in transit. \u201cStaff worked late last night to pack and get the vaccine ready for shipment by road and air to District Health Boards and vaccination centres around the country today, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWith our first July shipment safely on the ground and 1 million doses arriving this month, over the coming weeks we can start to ramp up the number of vaccines being administered. \u201dNew Zealand had distributed nearly all of its supply of the Pfizer vaccine in storage, giving DHBs enough stock to last until Wednesday. \u201cThe early arrival means no DHB will run out of vaccine. Teams have been working tirelessly to ensure vaccine doses have been getting to the right places to honour all existing appointments, and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. \u201dThe Ministry of Health has been in constant contact with Pfizer. The company helped secure an earlier release of the vaccines, while DHL planned a route with the quickest transit times to get the vaccines to New Zealand quickly and safely. \u201cI commend and thank everyone involved \u2013 including the wider vaccinator workforce \u2013 for their ongoing efforts to ensure people continue to get vaccinated, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOur goal is to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19 and vaccination is an important part of that. \u201d",
