title	call_to_action_label	call_to_action_explanation
JCVI issues advice on the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine	Weak	The announcement does not directly urge the public or reader to perform an action with a strong sense of urgency. Rather, the statement offers recommendations and guidelines to facilitate the successful roll out and uptake of the vaccine. While there is an implied expectation that those eligible for the vaccine should get it, there's no clear, explicit instruction compelling the reader to do so. The call to action is therefore weak.
New campaign to support vaccine roll-out backed by social media companies and British institutions	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action by updating their social media profiles with the newly launched frames and GIFs to show their support for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The government isn’t urgently commanding the readers to do so, but instead suggests that by utilizing these tools, they contribute to a larger campaign to showcase their support and gratitude towards NHS. Additionally, the instructions on how to change profile pictures on Facebook and Instagram indicate an expectation for readers to participate, thus making it a moderate call to action.
Sporting legends led by Sir Geoff Hurst urge over 70s to get Coronavirus vaccination	Strong	This announcement contains a strong call to action as it directly urges the public, especially those aged 70 and over, to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This call to action is reinforced through strong and compelling language such as "For goodness sake, just get it done... it’s in your interest, as well as that of your family, friends, workmates, and your country", "Don’t hesitate, just do it", "I encourage everyone to get it quick". Additionally, the public is also called to help those eligible get their vaccines, sign up to clinical trials, and stay informed. The use of nationally recognized figures who express their willingness to get vaccinated also strengthens the call to action.
No change to MHRA advice on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding	Weak	The announcement does encourage the public to take action, but this is done in a very passive manner. The call to action is embedded within the advisory information, merely directing the public to review the updated information in the 'Summary of Coronavirus Yellow Card Reporting' or 'the Summary of Product Characteristics'. Therefore, it can be considered a weak call to action. There are no strong words or phrases used to press for immediate action.
UK and India ramp up joint efforts on climate action	None	The government announcement primarily focuses on the collaboration between the UK and India in the areas of healthcare, climate change, and technology. The announcement provides information about the actions and plans of the UK government to strengthen ties with India and emphasizes the benefits of this partnership. However, it does not ask the reader or the public to take any specific action related to these topics. The only directives provided are aimed at the media for press inquiries, which does not constitute a public or reader call to action.
Rugby stars show support for booster campaign	Strong	The announcement contains a strong call to action as it is frequently using direct and compelling language to urge the reader to take immediate action. Sentences such as "Stars of women’s rugby are today urging fans and the public to Get Boosted Now." and “Kick COVID-19 into touch and Get Boosted Now." strongly push for the audience to get the COVID-19 booster shot. This is reinforced by personal appeals throughout and an overall tone of urgency, further elevating the call to action from moderate to strong.
Young people aged 12 to 15 to be offered a COVID-19 vaccine	Weak	The announcement primarily focuses on providing information about the government's initiative to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15, with details of how the vaccination program will be implemented, and noting that parental consent will be required. However, there is no clear, direct call to action urging individuals in this age group or their parents to ensure they receive the vaccine. It is merely suggested indirectly through the relay of the program's rollout and the actions to be taken by healthcare staff in obtaining consent. Most of the government's message is informational about these decisions and plans; the reader is not explicitly asked to respond or participate.
Government secures 5 million doses of Moderna vaccine	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to continue following safety measures like maintaining social distance, wearing face masks, and washing hands regularly to keep themselves and their loved ones safe from the virus. It also repeatedly reminds the public to not be complacent and to remain vigilant even in the face of promising vaccine news. Although the language used is not overly urgent or compelling, it is consistent and direct in its request for continued action from the public. Therefore, the call to action could be described as moderate.
Surge testing to be deployed in parts of west London	Moderate	The government announcement presents a moderate call to action. This is visible in sections where the public is "strongly encouraged" to take a COVID-19 PCR test regardless of presenting symptoms, to book a free test online or by phone, to follow their local council's advice on testing, and to accept the offer of twice-weekly rapid testing along with the PCR testing. The announcement also emphasizes the importance of those eligible getting their second COVID-19 vaccine shot sooner. Despite these calls to action, the urgency is moderate and the language does not compel immediate action with a strong sense of urgency or direct instructions. It advises the public to comply with enhanced testing and vaccination strategies to facilitate control of the viral variant's spread.
Further support confirmed for Oxford to slow COVID-19 infections	Moderate	The announcement encourages individuals to participate in COVID-19 control measures but does not necessarily use robust or urgent language. The call to action includes taking a test if offered, practicing health protocols like hands, face, space, and fresh air, as well as getting vaccinated. Although the necessity of these actions is stated, the language doesn't convey extreme urgency or explicit demand, hence it's considered a moderate call to action.
Access Consortium regulators pledge support to tackle COVID-19	None	The announcement is merely informing the public about the measures and steps being taken by the Access Consortium to battle the COVID-19 crisis. There is no specific action that the public or reader is being asked or urged to take. The focus of the announcement is not on the reader's participation or response, but on the efforts of the government and its global partners.
Moderna vaccine becomes third COVID-19 vaccine approved by UK regulator	Moderate	The announcement calls on the public to continue to obey national lockdown restrictions and remember to "stay alert, protect the NHS and save lives", even if they have had a vaccine. Although the language used doesn't press for immediate action, it advocates the importance of ongoing adherence to public health guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, the call to action is quite clear, but not emphatic or urgent. This qualifies it as a moderate call to action.
COVID-19 vaccines highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups	Moderate	The announcement strongly encourages individuals who are clinically vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly those with immune system concerns, to ensure they get both doses of the vaccine. It also suggests that those living with immunosuppressed adults should seek vaccination. While the language isn't overly compelling or urgent, it does imply the importance of these actions for health protection, therefore making it a moderate call to action.
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 November 2020	Moderate	The announcement contains a call to action, but it is not framed with strong, compelling language or a pressing sense of urgency. The government encourages the public to remain vigilant, follow the rules to keep the virus under control, and appreciate the efforts taken by public and healthcare authorities. They also indirectly suggest participation in upcoming vaccine trials and the importance of testing, though without a direct, compelling request. Hence, the label 'Moderate' is the most suitable.
Vaccines highly effective against B.1.617.2 variant after 2 doses	Strong	The announcement explicitly implores the public to take the vaccination. There are direct statements from the Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock and the Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi stressing the importance of getting the second dose of the vaccine to provide the strongest possible protection against COVID-19 and its variants. They are urging people to book their jab when offered, and to take full advantage of the high levels of protection the vaccines bring. The language used is compelling and aimed specifically at the public, indicating a strong call to action.
Universal vaccination of children and young people aged 12 to 15 years against COVID-19	None	The announcement is strictly informational, providing updates about the UK Chief Medical Officers' advice regarding COVID-19 vaccination for 12 to 15 year olds, and offering links to related statements and publications. It does not ask or encourage the public or reader to take any action or participate in any activities. It simply provides information for the public to be informed about government actions and plans.
Get Boosted Now text message to go out from Boxing Day	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action, using an impassioned and direct language aimed specifically at them. The phrases such as "Get Boosted Now", "it is vital to get a first and second jab", and "We are texting this Boxing Day for all eligible adults to Get Boosted Now" indicate a strong call to action. Additionally, the statement from Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid emphasizes the importance and urgency of getting the booster vaccine now, encouraging the public to incorporate this into their festive holiday traditions. The message not only gives direct orders but also conveys a sense of urgency for those not yet boosted to take the vaccination, and hence classified as a strong call to action.
COVID-19 vaccines have prevented thousands of deaths in older adults, new data shows	Strong	This government announcement is urging the public to take immediate and specific action, namely to get vaccinated as soon as they become eligible. The Health and Social Care Secretary and the PHE Head of Immunisation both provide direct statements to the public, stressing the importance of getting the vaccine and the benefits it has shown so far. The announcement explicitly encourages every eligible member of the public to participate in the vaccination program to save lives.
Over 30 million people urged to take up ‘vital’ flu and COVID-19 vaccines	Strong	This announcement utilizes a substantial amount of direct and compelling language aimed at the reader, urging them to take immediate action. Specific actions include taking up the offer for Flu and COVID-19 vaccination, practicing good hand hygiene, wearing masks, and covering one's mouth when coughing or sneezing. The announcement explains why these measures are vital, suggesting an immediate threat from both viruses, and emphasizes the potential severity of co-infection. Hence, the containment of the viruses depends significantly on the actions of the public.
Environment Secretary tours Cornish mass vaccination centre	Strong	This government announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action with a direct and compelling language. The message "All those eligible for a vaccination are urged to take them up to make sure that they are able to get the protection they need" directly pushes the readers to get vaccinated. Additionally, the message concludes with a strong call to action to people aged 70 and older to contact the NHS and book their appointments for the vaccine, emphasizing it with the line "don’t wait for your letter, just pick up the phone, or book online now". Therefore, it is a strong call to action as it directly insists the public to participate in the vaccination drive.
Business Secretary calls on businesses to continue supporting vaccine rollout	Moderate	This government announcement encourages businesses to continue supporting the national vaccine rollout effort. While it does not use compelling language or stress immediate urgency, it clearly communicates the actions the desired party - businesses of all sizes - should take. Actions such as allowing workers paid time off to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and offering workspace to be used as vaccination centres are discussed. The announcement does place a focus on the participation of businesses with multiple examples provided and praises given to companies who have already pledged support to build a motivational tone. These factors contribute to a moderate call to action.
Second COVID-19 vaccine authorised by medicines regulator	Weak	The announcement does urge the public to continue to follow guidelines and restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19, specifically under the words of Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock where he says, "While it is a time to be hopeful, it is so vital everyone continues to play their part to drive down infections." Additionally, there's a message to those who have received their first vaccination to await contact from the NHS for the rescheduled appointment of the second dose. However, these calls for action are not strongly emphasized or a major focus of the announcement. The primary focus of the document is to inform the public about the vaccine approval, its distribution, and its benefits.
'2020 – a year like no other' - Reflections about very busy times in Chile	Weak	The message does have a weak call to action in which it encourages the reader to follow the British Embassy in Santiago's activities on different social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Flicker, Instagram, and LinkedIn. There are no strong directives or urgent prompts for the reader to get involved or take immediate action. The primary focus of the announcement is on providing an overview of what has been done over the past year, rather than soliciting public engagement.
COVID-19 vaccine supply and manufacturing in the UK	Weak	The government announcement focuses mainly on informing the public about the COVID-19 vaccine rollout progress and procedure in the UK. While it does emphasize the importance of global solutions and encourages manufacturers to make vaccines available at cost, there is a lack of direct and specific instructions for the public or reader to take immediate action. The call to action, therefore, is relatively weak compared to a strong call to action which would involve direct instructions or compelling language aimed specifically at the public or readers to take immediate action.
Foreign Secretary thanks medics on vaccine frontline	Moderate	The announcement does two things: firstly, it urges those who are eligible for the vaccine to get it as soon as possible. This is a direct call to action, although it is specific to only one segment of the public, those who are eligible for the vaccine. Secondly, it encourages everyone to stay at home if possible, to protect the NHS and save lives. This is another critical call to action targeted at the entire public, but the language is relatively moderate, suggesting rather than forcefully insisting. Therefore, this statement is categorized as a moderate call to action.
Clinical trialists to be offered 'top-up' vaccine doses	Moderate	The announcement moderately encourages the public to continue participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials, and also outlines the new opportunity for trial participants to receive additional approved vaccine doses for international travel. While the government does not use direct and compelling language here, it urges trialists to avail of their new option for additional vaccinations and to take a booster dose if eligible. It additionally asks trial participants to look out for incoming letters with further details and calls them to direct their questions to the trial team. This shows a sense of moderated urgency for action, particularly with the context of the pandemic and the need for a vaccinated population. It also makes a general appeal for more countries to recognize trial participants as fully vaccinated, however, the primary target audience of the announcement is the UK public.
New vaccine marketing campaign urges millions to boost their immunity this winter	Strong	The announcement not only gives crucial information but also directly calls upon its readers to take immediate action on a few occasions. This strong call to action is evident in phrases like "we are actively encouraging, through our new marketing campaign, everybody eligible to come forward for both jabs as soon as possible", "If eligible please come forward for your jabs as soon as you can – it is important to be protected before any winter surges begin", among others. These statements use strong, compelling language urging the public to get vaccinated for flu and take the Covid-19 booster shots.
Minister calls for at risk groups to get booster jabs	Strong	Multiple authoritative voices in the announcement – including Kemi Badenoch, Minister for Equalities, Maggie Throup, Minister for Vaccines and Public Health, Professor Kevin Fenton, and Dr Raghib Ali – urgently implore the public to get their first, second, and booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. They directly address those who are unvaccinated, not fully vaccinated, or eligible for a booster shot, and emphasize that vaccines provide key protection against the virus. This represents a strong call to action as it uses direct and compelling language to target specific groups to act urgently for their protection as well as for the wider community. The announcement also calls for action by encouraging people to visit the NHS website for further information and to book their vaccination appointments.
30 million people in UK receive first dose of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine	Strong	The announcement contains multiple, direct and urgent calls to the public to get vaccinated. It uses phrases such as "Everyone over 50 or those who are clinically vulnerable urged to come forward for vaccines as soon as possible", "When you get the call - get the jab", and "I urge everyone, regardless of race or religion, to come forward for the vaccine when it’s your turn." Moreover, it makes a specific appeal at the end, saying "we want everyone to take up the offer of an appointment when they are invited - all those 50 and over can book a jab now." Each of these instances represents an urgent, clear call to action for members of the public to get vaccinated.
One year anniversary of UK approving Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine	Moderate	The announcement features a moderate call to action as it encourages the public to get vaccinated but does not underscore an immediate or urgent need. Specifically, Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid tells everyone to "roll up your sleeves and get your jabs", and Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup urges people to "take advantage and get your vaccines". Despite the necessity implied, direct or compelling language urging immediate action is not used, hence the classification as a moderate call to action.
Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf-life extended from 5 to 31 days, says MHRA	None	The announcement is primarily informative in nature, explaining the improved storage conditions for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the implications this has for its wider use in various healthcare settings. However, there are no specific instructions or calls for action directed at the public or readers. The announcement does not ask the public to respond in any way, such as by getting vaccinated or contacting their healthcare providers; instead, it is just updating them about the ongoing effort in vaccine management.
Across borders: the UK’s multilateral response to a global health crisis	None	The given announcement doesn't urge the public or the reader to take any specific action. Instead, it mainly informs about the steps and measures taken by the UK government and its partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The text discusses vaccine development, partnerships for equitable access, and global cooperation, but doesn't make direct appeals for the reader’s involvement.
Independent batch release testing of COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccines by the NIBSC	None	This announcement does not contain any advice, recommendations, or requests directed towards the public or reader to undertake any specific action. Rather, the text is informative, detailing the independent vaccination testing procedures and the responsible bodies involved. The purpose is to inform about the steps taken to ensure the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine, but it doesn't ask the reader to respond or participate in any way.
Almost 100% of people have antibodies after second vaccine	Strong	This government announcement strongly expresses the important role the public plays in the fight against COVID-19. It actively encourages people to get vaccinated using direct, compelling language aimed at the reader. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid and Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi both emphasized the need to get the vaccine and especially the importance of the second dose. It's marked as a "strong call to action" because it urges everyone to come forward for the vaccine, emphasizes that vaccines are the best protection available, and clearly tries to drive home the importance of both doses for everyone.
More than 2 in 3 adults receive both doses of vaccine	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to receive both doses of the vaccine, underlined by direct statements such as "All adults are eligible to get their second dose after 8 weeks" and "If you’re over 18, book both your jabs today." It directly asks for public action, citing benefits such as non-quarantine after returning from an amber list country, no legal requirement for self-isolation being a close contact after double vaccination. This can be seen particularly in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement of "Now let’s finish the job" and Sajid Javid's urging of "please come forward for your jab if you haven’t already". These strong calls from leaders highlight the importance of public participation in this campaign.
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine authorised by UK medicines regulator	Moderate	In the presented announcement, there is moderate urgency for the public to take action. Specifically, Secretary Matt Hancock urges everyone to continue following rules to keep coronavirus cases low, even as the vaccine becomes more available. This call to action is reinforced by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam who advises everyone to follow rules until enough people have been vaccinated. Although the language used doesn't strongly urge or compel immediate action or drastic changes in the public's behaviour, it does encourage continued adherence to protective measures amid the vaccine rollout.
Government sets out new action to tackle B1.617.2 variant	Moderate	The announcement does encourage the public to take action, but there isn't an extremely high sense of urgency in its tone. Messages such as, "please exercise caution, get a test, and as soon as you’re eligible, get the jab," definitely press the public to act responsibly by taking precautions, getting tested, and receiving the vaccination, but the language remains somewhat measured and moderate, rather than pressuring or demanding immediate, intense action.
Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine: MHRA statement	None	This announcement does not call on the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses on descriptions of upcoming processes related to the approval of COVID-19 vaccines, and information on MHRA's assessment methods and principles. The announcement is informing the reader about the government's steps and plans in the context of the vaccine rollout, without asking for any type of action or participation from them.
New support to help vulnerable countries tackle Omicron	None	The announcement predominantly informs about the UK government's initiatives and steps taken to combat the COVID-19 Omicron variant, focusing particularly on aid to Africa and other vulnerable countries. It includes contributions towards testing, oxygen supplies, hygiene campaigns, and worldwide vaccine sharing. However, it does not include any specific call to action directed towards the public or reader. The announcement solely focuses on providing information rather than urging the public or reader to take any particular action.
New study finds strong immune response following COVID-19 vaccination	Strong	In this announcement, there is a strong call to action as it clearly and assertively urges the public to get vaccinated and more importantly, to make sure they get their second dose. Statements such as "It is vital everyone gets a second dose when invited" and Health Minister Lord Bethell's urging for everyone to "come forward to be vaccinated when invited and to take up both doses of the vaccine" underscore the importance the government places on public participation in the vaccine rollout. There is also a call to continue following "Hands, Face, Space" guidelines, even after vaccination. The call to action is persistent and directed at the public throughout the announcement.
Unvaccinated mothers urge pregnant women to get jabbed	Strong	This government announcement strongly urges pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19, urging them to "get vaccinated as soon as possible", "take up the vaccine", and "get your vaccines as soon as they can". It includes personal testimonies from unvaccinated mothers who suffered severe consequences from COVID-19, along with statistics and expert advice that underline the urgency and importance of this call to action. The call to action is clear, direct, and presented with strong emphasis on the urgent need for pregnant women to get vaccinated for their own protection and the well-being of their babies.
Certification for vaccine clinical trial participants	None	This announcement doesn't provide any specific information or request directed at the public or reader. It is merely a list of individuals who have provided science advice to various governments, without any mention of guidelines, advice, recommendations, or instructions for action to be taken by the reader or public.
Nationwide drive to urge vaccine take-up in priority groups	Strong	The announcement clearly and quite strongly urges the public to take immediate action. It uses direct and compelling language to emphasize the importance and necessity of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The call to action is persistent throughout the announcement, specifically towards those who are eligible for the vaccine, health and social care workers, and individuals over the age of 70 who have not yet been vaccinated. The message includes direct instructions on how to book a jab and underlines the imperative role of everyone in fighting the pandemic. Hence, it represents a strong call to action.
Modified COVID-19 vaccines for variants to be fast-tracked, says MHRA and other regulators	None	The announcement does not include any call to action. Instead, it focuses on informing and explaining the regulatory process for approving modified COVID-19 vaccines. The note by the Chief Scientific Officer is reassuring and encourages public confidence in the process but does not instruct or request the public to perform a particular action. The contact data for media enquiries is standard and does not constitute a call to action for the general public.
Letter from the Health and Social Care Secretary on COVID-19 vaccination in people with learning disabilities	None	The announcement is just mentioning a correspondence between the Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock and Professor Wei Shen Lim at the JCVI. It does not contain any direct or indirect requests for action from the public or reader.
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine gives hope as Tier 3 and 4 measures extend to wider areas	Moderate	Although the majority of this announcement touches on informing and describing government actions or plans regarding COVID-19, there is a moderate call to action when the speaker talks about the responsibility to keep the virus under control and following the Tier 3 and Tier 4 measures. However, the call to action is not strongly directed at the public and lacks a sense of immediacy, qualifying as a "moderate" call to action.
Sanofi Pasteur COVID-19 vaccine authorised by MHRA	None	This announcement is primarily informative, providing details about the authorisation of a new vaccine, its components, results of clinical tests, and side effects. However, it does not contain any specific instructions or urges for the public to take immediate action, such as getting vaccinated. Instead, the focus is on conveying the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.
World's first coronavirus Human Challenge study receives ethics approval in the UK	Moderate	The announcement encourages healthy young adults, ages 18 to 30, to volunteer for a study in the understanding and countering of Covid-19. However, while the call is clear, it does not use particularly urgent or compelling language. The audience is addressed multiple times and the importance of their potential participation is well-explained, but the overall tone remains moderately urgent, hence the "Moderate" label.
Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine approved	None	This announcement primarily focuses on detailing the approval process and specifications of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, as well as providing updates on the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It does not explicitly urge the public to get vaccinated or to take any other particular action. It primarily serves to inform and provide transparency about regulatory processes and vaccine details.
Novavax COVID-19 vaccine approved for 12 to 17s by MHRA	None	The announcement is primarily intended to inform the public about the approval of the Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine for use in 12- to 17-year-olds. It offers detailed information about the authority, approval process, and committees involved in this decision. However, there is no explicit call to action directed at the public or reader. Rather, the message provides updates on regulatory decisions without suggesting any specific actions that the public should take in response to this information.
Latest monitoring data confirms safety of COVID-19 vaccines	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action, particularly in reporting any observed adverse reactions after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The language used, such as "encouraged to report", indicates a call to action, but there is a moderate sense of urgency as the aim is to ensure safety, rather than an immediate, critical need for response. There is also a respectful thank you message to those who have already reported potential side effects.
Minister Zahawi update to the House on step 4 and NHS COVID Pass	Moderate	This government announcement involves a moderate call to action. The speaker encourages members of the public to continue with measures like social adherence to the "small steps" such as wearing masks, ventilating rooms, and getting regular tests. The call to use the NHS COVID Pass is also highlighted. Towards the end, a call is made for the public to get vaccinated, but the language used is more suggestive than directive. The speaker also urges people, who are likely proprietors, to consider using the COVID Pass in their venues but does not insist on immediate action.
Public urged to get boosted as 22 million top-up jabs delivered	Strong	The announcement repeatedly urges the public to take immediate and crucial action in getting the booster vaccine, particularly highlighting its importance in light of the new Omicron variant. It places strong emphasis on booking a booster jab appointment as soon as possible for those eligible, and emphasizes the importance of participating in the COVID-19 vaccination programme to protect themselves and others. This constitutes a strong call to action, coupled with a sense of urgency, to obtain the booster shot. The language used is direct and compelling, aimed at encouraging the public to take immediate action. Besides, people over 50 are also openly encouraged to sign up for the national antiviral study indicating another strong call to action.
Testing measures to ensure young people return to classrooms	Moderate	The government announcement suggests a moderate call to action, as it encourages students, teachers, and the general public to regularly self-test, continue with precautionary measures such as wearing face masks and maintaining good hygiene, and get vaccinated or receive boosters. Although the message itself is urgent as it relates to public health, the language used is moderate and advisory in nature, not necessarily urging immediate action. The announcement also sets forth measures that schools and colleges are taking, but this is not considered a call to action towards the public.
Sir Lenny Henry urges Black Britons to take COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the Black community in the UK, in particular, to get vaccinated when their turn comes. It uses influential figures and heartfelt language to directly appeal to these individuals, conveying agency and urgency. There are numerous instances where this call to action is evident, as seen in quotes like "take the jab" and "when your turn comes, take the jab," as well as "I’m saying, when your turn comes, take the jab". Additionally, it is mentioned for readers who have received the vaccination letter to log on to the national booking service and choose from vaccination sites, or call a provided hotline. The strong call to action is reiterated in this statement: "Don’t let coronavirus cost even more Black lives," followed by the reaffirmations of "We love you. We don’t want you to get sick. We don’t want you to die." Such lines are enforcing the urgent call for the public to take the vaccine.
Two-thirds of UK adults receive first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement clearly and firmly instructs the public several times to get vaccinated when it is their turn, emphasizing the importance of this action in controlling the pandemic. With phrases such as "public urged to get the jab when their time comes", "I strongly encourage everyone to take up the offer", and "I encourage everyone to book their jab as soon as they’re offered it, and to come back for their second dose", the announcement is presenting a strong call to action. Additionally, the announcement uses compelling language and offers a sense of urgency, underpinning the urgency of this public health issue.
Government publishes plan for the largest vaccination programme in British history	Moderate	This announcement includes some encouragement for the public to take action such as abiding by restrictions, and volunteering in the vaccine rollout program, therefore it falls under moderate call to action. The statement by Matt Hancock: "it is mission critical that everybody abides by the restrictions in the coming weeks", calls for the public to follow restrictions. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also encourages businesses to allow their staff to volunteer in the vaccine rollout: "I encourage businesses, wherever possible, to allow their staff time and scope to volunteer." However, overall, the language is not overwhelmingly direct or urgent.
JCVI issues advice on COVID-19 vaccination of children and young people	Weak	The announcement mainly states factual information and informs about the recommendations by the JCVI. Though it advises children at increased risk and young people living with an immunosuppressed person to get vaccinated, it doesn't use very direct or compelling language which suggests a weak call to action. It also does not outline explicit steps for the public to follow or stress urgency in terms of immediate vaccination. Instead, it carefully outlines the reasons behind selective vaccination, letting individuals decide if they fit into these categories.
UK government’s response to Moderna’s publication of efficacy data for its COVID-19 vaccine	None	The announcement primarily provides information on the government's efforts to acquire and distribute potential COVID-19 vaccines. It does not give explicit instructions or suggestions for the public or reader to participate or respond in a specific way. The focus is on informing the audience about the current situation without requesting any immediate action from them.
Vaccine status drives over one million new users to the NHS App	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to use the NHS App by asserting the many benefits, such as accessing vaccine status, booking GP appointments, ordering repeat prescriptions, and registering for organ donation. The encouragement is not presented with strong urgency or pressure, rather it is explained in softer terms with emphasis on the convenience that comes with the app usage. This, therefore, makes the announcement to possess a moderate call to action.
Minister Nadhim Zahawi Oral Statement on step 4 of the road map	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take several actions- getting the jab, going for the second dose, getting the booster shot, getting tested, considering the advice, and continuing to act with caution. However, these calls to action are delivered in a moderate tone, conveying some urgency but not demanding immediate action. Words such as “keeping reinforcing," "must continue," and "help us" indicate an encouragement for the public to take part in the effort, but it doesn't involve language that demands immediate action or threatens severe consequences if these actions are not taken.
Statement on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine following JCVI update	Moderate	The announcement encourages the audience to get vaccinated when they are called forward, emphasizing that vaccines provide strong protection against COVID-19. The language used is indeed urging but not overly compelling, maintaining a moderate urgency level. Additionally, the directive is quite clear, albeit not bolstered with a high level of urgency, hence classifying it as a moderate call to action.
More than 2.2 million people in UK receive first dose of COVID-19 vaccine	None	The announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. It primarily provides information regarding the number of people who have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the prioritization of vaccinations, and the locations of the first seven vaccination sites. While this information could be considered implicitly motivational, there is no direct request or encouragement for the reader to take any particular action such as getting vaccinated or following specific guidelines.
UK regulator confirms that people should continue to receive the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca	Moderate	The announcement repeatedly encourages individuals to still get the AstraZeneca vaccine despite concerns about blood clots and places emphasis on the critical importance of doing so given the overall benefit of preventing COVID-19. The call to action is moderate as it does provide clear instructions for action (to get the vaccine when it is their turn, and to seek medical attention if experiencing certain side effects) but it does not use particularly urgent or compelling language to stimulate immediate action.
F1 stars including Lewis Hamilton back COVID-19 vaccine drive	Strong	The announcement strongly implores the public to take immediate action. This includes getting COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, taking up the flu jab offer if eligible, and visiting any of the available vaccination centres, pharmacies, or GP practices. The call to action is further emphasized through the involvement of F1 drivers, who appeal directly to fans to participate in the vaccination rollout, and the Vaccines Minister, who urges those eligible to come forward and get protected as soon as possible. It highlights the continued urgency to get vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 in the context of the new Omicron variant. The call to action is maintained throughout the announcement, making it a strong one.
UK marks 132 million life-saving COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021	Strong	The announcement contains a powerful and persistent urging for the public to get their COVID-19 booster vaccine, with a continual emphasis on the phrase "Get Boosted Now". The call to action is aimed at enhancing the public's protection against the Omicron variant by vaccinating as many people as possible. There is a clear and direct invitation to book vaccination slots online or visit vaccination centers, highlighting the government's effort to ensure everyone's safety and urging the public to participate. The government even encourages people who have recovered from acute illnesses, or those who have had COVID-19 and after 28 days have passed, to seek the booster jab to ensure their protection. This constant provocation suggests a strong call to action directed at the public.
Health chiefs encourage more pregnant women to get their COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement urges pregnant women to get vaccinated, emphasizing the importance for their own health as well as that of their babies. It uses compelling language to highlight the severity of COVID-19 in later stages of pregnancy and risks of premature birth, utilizing healthcare professionals' quotes to emphasize the urgency. The recurring phrases 'urge', 'we strongly urge', 'we recommend', 'it's so important', 'come forward', and 'take up the offer' signify an immediate need for action among this targeted group. There is also a strong call to action for expectant mothers to seek professional advice if they have any concerns or queries about taking the vaccine.
UK Government doubles armed forces support for vaccine roll-out in Wales	None	The announcement is informing readers about what the government and armed forces are doing to aid in the COVID-19 vaccination program. It's filled with details on the activities and plans of these organizations, but there is no explicit call to action that asks the public or reader to do anything specific.
JCVI advises use of additional bivalent vaccine for autumn booster campaign	Moderate	The government announcement moderately encourages the public to receive the autumn booster vaccine when it's offered, especially for those eligible. This is seen in the statement by Professor Wei Shen Lim, who asserts, "We strongly encourage everyone who is eligible to have their booster vaccine this autumn when it is offered." However, the overall language of this announcement is informative and explanatory, rather than urging immediate or compelling action, hence it's classified as a moderate call to action.
Approval of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine: Foreign Secretary's statement	None	The announcement primarily focuses on relaying information about the efforts and contributions of the UK, Oxford University, and AstraZeneca in global COVID-19 solutions. It highlights the collaborations, donations, and commitments to ensure that vaccines reach developing countries. However, no specific action is directed towards the public or the reader. Actions of the government and other entities are outlined in detail, but there are no explicit instructions or suggestions for the reader's response or participation.
UK calls for ceasefires to vaccinate people against COVID-19	None	The announcement is primarily informational, detailing the UK's initiatives and plans to promote global ceasefires and provide vaccinations in conflict zones. It underlines the UK's leadership and efforts in global vaccine distribution. However, it does not directly request the public or reader to take a specific action or encourage participation in a certain way. The contact information provided at the end is for media enquiries, not a public call to action.
Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years	None	The announcement does not call upon the public or reader to take any kind of action. Rather, it informs them about the approval of Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years, the safety and dosage details, and notes that it will be up to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to decide whether to recommend this vaccine for this new age group as part of the UK's COVID-19 vaccination program. The announcement is communicative and informational, sharing regulatory decisions and process, but does not ask for public response or participation.
Transport Secretary hails work of transport industry in vaccination roll-out	Moderate	The announcement contains a moderate call to action in the sentence, "I urge everyone aged 70 and over who hasn’t yet had a vaccination to come forward and contact the NHS to get their jab". The call to action is clear and direct, but the language used is not particularly forceful or urging immediate response, instead encouraging those in the specified age group to take the described action.
Statement from the UK Chief Medical Officers on the prioritisation of first doses of COVID-19 vaccines	None	The announcement focuses mostly on informing the public about the rollout of the vaccines, the scheduling of the doses, and changes in specific advisories. The statement describes the government's plans and the rationale behind them, but does not explicitly instruct the reader to take any definitive action. It is more informative and advisory in nature, aiming to update the public about recent developments related to the vaccination program.
One year anniversary of UK deploying Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine	Strong	This announcement has a strong call to action, explicitly urging the public to come forward for their vaccines and booster shots to increase immunity against COVID-19. The government representatives, Sajid Javid and Maggie Throup, directly appeal to the public to get vaccinated and protect themselves, their families, and the progress made against the pandemic. Professor Stephen Powis also urges people to use available slots for first, second, and booster jabs. This call to action is repeated multiple times throughout the announcement, emphasizing its importance and the urgency of the situation.
Regular asymptomatic testing paused in additional settings	Moderate	This government announcement encourages people to take particular action in response to changes in COVID-19 testing and vaccination policies. It directs eligible individuals to sign up for autumn booster shots and those who haven't had a COVID-19 vaccine to take up the offer for self-protection and community safety. However, the language is not particularly compelling or immediate, it is more suggestive, hence it falls under a moderate call to action.
Vaccine rollout and variant mitigation	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to continue following current COVID-19 safety guidelines. There is some urgency in the language used, particularly in stating that "this is still a lethal virus that is capable of causing devastation and disruption". However, the announcement does not use direct, compelling language to dictate the reader's actions, hence this is categorized as a moderate, rather than a strong call to action.
More than 90% of people receive first dose of COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement utilizes very direct and compelling language to encourage the public to take action. Statements such as "Public reminded to Get Boosted Now to protect against Omicron," "the Prime Minister and NHS England launched the Get Boosted Now campaign on the 12 December, urging all eligible adults to come forward for their booster before the New Year," and "I want to be clear – it is never too late to come forward for your vaccine" strongly urge immediate action. These calls to action emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated as soon as possible to protect against the Omicron variant. The announcement also includes direct quotes from the Health and Social Care Secretary and the Vaccines Minister to further reinforce this urgency. The constant repetition of the phrase "Get Boosted Now" further highlights the intensity of the call to action.
New vaccine advice for adults living with adults who are immunosuppressed	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to get the COVID-19 vaccine with a particular focus on those over 16 who live with adults with weakened immune systems. While it doesn't use direct, compelling language, it highlights the importance of this action to limit the spread of virus to vulnerable individuals. However, it stops short of direct guidance on how to proceed, which would have formed a strong call to action.
Statement on offering COVID-19 vaccines to at-risk young people	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action but without a sense of immediate urgency. The Health and Social Care Secretary specifically encourages everyone who is eligible to get their COVID-19 vaccinations as soon as they can, suggesting the importance of taking part in the vaccination program. However, the language used does not apply a strong sense of urgency or direct request.
Statement from Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock on testing and vaccinations	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action by adhering to the specified rules to mitigate the spread of the virus. The language used suggests the importance of each individual's compliance, highlighting that "we must all play our part and follow the rules that we know can bend the curve." However, while the emphasis is on the collective effort, it doesn't convey a sense of immediate urgency or direct, specific actions the reader should take; this is why it is classified as a moderate call to action.
One-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine approved by the MHRA	None	The announcement does not directly urge the public or readers to take specific action, instead it focuses on delivering information about the approval of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, explains the process, give details about who can receive the vaccine and provides additional notes and contact information for media inquiries. While it does mention who can get this vaccine, it's not in a way that actively encourages or requests action from the reader.
Janssen coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine authorised by UK medicines regulator	Moderate	The majority of the announcement is informational in nature, with updates from the Government and the MHRA on the newly authorised Janssen vaccine and the progress of the vaccination programme. However, there is a moderately worded call to action embedded within the announcement. Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock and Vaccine Deployment Minister, Nadhim Zahawi encourage the public to receive their jabs when eligible. The language is encouraging rather than commanding, hence the classification as a moderate call to action.
PM hails ‘herculean effort’ of life science companies to defeat coronavirus	None	The government announcement describes plans and actions led by the Prime Minister, pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders in the process of developing and distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. It also emphasizes the collaborative efforts and future plans to prevent pandemics. However, it does not specifically urge the public or reader to undertake any particular action. The information is positioned to inform and update, rather than incite public action.
Statement from Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi on vaccine deployment	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to participate in the vaccination program, by hinting at its expansion and the accessibility of the National Booking service. The call to action is more explicit towards the end, where the reader is urged to "play our part by sticking to the rules and remembering those simple steps: hands, face, space." This suggests a moderate level of urgency, as it emphasizes the importance of preventive measures during the vaccine rollout and the role of every individual in the fight against COVID-19. However, it's not strongly compelling immediate action.
Every adult in UK offered COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement contains direct statements urging the public to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. There are multiple calls throughout the text, including from the Prime Minister and the Health and Social Care Secretary. Phrases such as "Public are urged to come forward for jabs as soon as possible", "People are urged to get their first and second doses as soon as possible" and "Please come forward for your vaccines if you haven’t already" add to the strong call to action, directing the audience to take immediate action in regards to vaccination. Furthermore, a sense of urgency and importance of getting the vaccine is created by highlighting the benefits of being vaccinated, such as easing of restrictions, as well as the potential consequences of not being vaccinated.
Letter from the Health and Social Care Secretary on COVID-19 vaccination to protect severely immunosuppressed adults	None	The announcement is merely indicating that there is correspondence between Matt Hancock, the Health and Social Care Secretary, and Professor Wei Shen Lim at the Joint Committee on Vaction and Immunisation (JCVI). It contains no urging or encouragement towards the public or reader to engage in any action, either by way of guidelines, recommendations or immediate action. Instead, it appears to be informing about a contact or dialogue relating to health and social care amidst the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
All adults in England offered COVID-19 booster vaccine	Strong	The announcement urges the public to take immediate action in multiple places. It strongly pushes for everyone who has not yet taken the booster jab to "Get Boosted Now". Phrases such as "grab your jab" and "book your booster now" emphasize the urgency. It also directly addresses those who may have delayed their appointment due to other illnesses or COVID-19 infection and encourages them to book a jab as soon as they recover or 28 days have passed. Further, it mentions how easy it is to get the vaccine, making it a clear call to action with a high level of urgency.
New vaccines partnership to rapidly respond to new virus variants	Moderate	The government announcement contains a moderate call to action directed at the public. The Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi urges the public to "continue to take up the chance to have a vaccine when they are invited to," emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Although the call to action is clear, it is presented as an encouragement rather than a demand or urgent plea, hence it's classified as a moderate call to action.
Pre-departure testing removed for vaccinated travellers	Moderate	The government announcement presents various calls to action throughout the text, although none can be considered very strong or immediate. These include guidance for eligible travelers to understand they can take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR on their arrival, the prompt for those receiving a positive lateral flow test result to self-isolate immediately and order a NHS PCR test, guidance to wear face coverings, wash hands regularly, and work from home, as well as the recommendation for unvaccinated passengers to continue following the testing protocol and self-isolation period. The most emphatic call made perhaps is the emphasis on those who have not been vaccinated to come forward for their vaccine. While there are directives present, the overall tone in delivering these guidelines is not highly pressuring or compelling, thus explaining the moderate label.
Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine authorised by UK medicines regulator	Moderate	The announcement gives a call for public action in a couple of areas: compliance with local restrictions and continued following of "hands, face, space" guidelines. While it doesn't use direct and strong language, it emphasizes the importance of these actions in suppressing the virus and keeping the NHS from being overwhelmed, correlating public action with the success of the vaccination program. The language suggests that the public's response continues to be vital amidst the release of the vaccine, hence it's considered a moderate call to action.
The most vulnerable and health and care workers offered COVID-19 jab as government hits target to protect those most at risk	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action with a moderate sense of urgency, primarily in two forms: encouraging people who have been offered a vaccine to come forward and receive it, and reminding everyone, vaccinated or not, to continue following safety measures like staying at home when possible. The tone isn't urgent or forceful and the language isn't overtly compelling, hence making it a moderate call to action.
Further support for Birmingham, Blackpool, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Liverpool City region and Warrington to tackle Delta (B1.617.2) variant	Strong	The announcement strongly encourages the public to act by getting tested, taking the vaccine when eligible, and upholding the safety measures such as maintaining hygiene, social distancing, and avoiding unnecessary travel. The Health Secretary and the Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency both directly appeal to the public to take these steps to suppress and control the spread of the virus variant. They emphasize that these actions are instrumental in combating the virus and ensuring community safety. The call to action is thus direct, urgent, and targeted at the public, which classified it as a strong call to action.
Oral statement to update on the Omicron variant	Moderate	In this announcement, the government encourages the public to take action but it is not strongly worded or asserting a high degree of urgency. There are calls for individuals to take steps such as getting vaccinated when the time comes, following the updated rules, and getting rapid regular tests. These calls to actions are important, but the tone is more informative than enforcing immediate action and the messaging leans more towards recommendations rather than commands.
More leading businesses join vaccine uptake drive	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public, specifically young people, to get vaccinated and incentivizes them with offers from businesses. Statements such as "Young people urged to come forward for both doses as soon as possible", "get the jab as soon as possible and take advantage of these excellent offers" and "urge everyone to get the jab and get shopping with these excellent discounts" explicitly call the public to take immediate action to get vaccinated.
Government and faith leaders join forces to support booster drive	Strong	The announcement uses compelling language to drive immediate action from the public, emphasizing the urgency by noting the increase of the Omicron variant. It repeatedly requests the public to take the COVID-19 vaccine, specifically encouraging those from every background to participate in this "national mission" and "national effort." This is seen in statements such as "we need everyone from every community to come forward to get ahead of this virus" and "it is never too late to get your vaccine." They also provide practical steps on how to get vaccinated and specifically address faith communities and minority ethnic communities in their appeal, making this a strong call to action.
UK to host global summit with CEPI to speed up new vaccine development	None	The announcement is purely informational and outlines the UK government's plan to host a summit with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to raise funds for vaccine research and development to combat future pandemics. There is no indication within the announcement that directs or encourages the public or reader to take any sort of action.
Government and life science industry join forces on 100 Days Mission for future pandemics	None	Although the announcement talks about collective efforts in combating disease and pandemic and the importance of collaboration across various sectors, it does not directly ask the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses on informing what the government, industry leaders, and academia are planning and doing to prepare for future pandemics. Moreover, the announcement is more directed towards reporting on G7 Health Ministers' meetings and plans for future pandemic preparedness, rather than requesting action from the general public.
Update on the Vaccine Taskforce: 1 March 2021	None	This announcement primarily provides an update on the changes in the management and administration of the COVID-19 vaccination program. It emphasizes the UK government's accomplishments, but it does not urge or encourage the public or the reader to do or take any specific action. Instead, the announcement focuses on explaining government decisions, the role of the Vaccine Taskforce, and the future plans of the vaccine rollout. It concludes with outlet for media queries, but it doesn't actively urge the reader to participate or respond.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam opinion piece in The Sunday Telegraph	Moderate	This announcement encourages the reader to take action but does so in a fairly moderate way. The recognized actions include individuals getting both of their vaccine doses, adhering to guidelines even after being vaccinated to not aid in further spread of the virus, and supporting the ongoing strategy of vaccinating as many individuals as possible. Although not directly urging immediate action, the tone and context suggest the effectiveness of the suggested actions in having a direct impact on managing the pandemic.
UK aid and Unilever reach 1 billion people with global hygiene campaign to tackle COVID-19	None	The announcement focuses primarily on the collaborative efforts between the UK government, Unilever and other partners in tackling the spread of COVID-19, specifically through hygiene campaigns, providing sanitation supplies, and vaccinations. It does not specifically urge or suggest any measure for the public or reader to take, but serves as primarily an information update on their initiatives. Therefore, there is no call to action directed at the public or reader.
Armed Forces now working in hospitals, vaccine centres, and testing across all four nations	None	The announcement primarily provides updates about the involvement and contribution of Armed Forces personnel in the vaccine rollout, testing, and support for the National Health Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not explicitly or implicitly instruct the public to take any specific action, nor does it request that readers do something particular in response to the given information. Instead, the content is focused on informing the reader about the efforts of the government and military to combat the pandemic.
4 in 5 people aged 16 and over vaccinated with both doses	Strong	The announcement contains several direct appeals to the public, urging them in clear and compelling terms to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The text uses lines such as "Getting your vaccine has never been easier, and I urge everyone to continue to play their part by getting the jab to protect themselves, their families and their communities", "Everyone eligible should not delay in getting their jab as soon as possible", and "The message for 16 and 17 year olds is ‘don’t miss out on half terms plans, good times, and the COVID jab’". This language strongly encourages its audience to act, emphasizing the importance of action for their personal benefit and the wellbeing of their communities.
MHRA statement on booster doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines	None	The announcement primarily focuses on communicating changes in regulatory concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and their potential use as booster shots. It does not directly urge or engage the public or reader to take any specific actions. Instead, it serves to inform the public about regulatory decisions and the potential use of vaccines. The information about media enquiries and the news centre is also aimed at detailed explanation, rather than directing the reader to take some action.
JCVI issues interim advice on COVID-19 booster vaccination	Moderate	The announcement does encourage the public, specifically particular high-risk groups and frontline workers, to participate in getting vaccinated in the proposed two-stage COVID-19 booster programme and annual flu vaccine. However, the call to action is presented more as guidance and not a strong or urgent requirement. It primarily focuses on providing information about the plans and goals of the program, urging participation in a moderate tone.
COVID-19 vaccinations and community-based social care workers	None	The announcement simply states that a letter from Minister Whately has been issued outlining plans for vaccinating community-based social care workers. It does not include any specific requests, demands, or recommendations directed at the public or reader, instead providing informational content on government plans.
Community Champions to give COVID-19 vaccine advice and boost take up	Weak	The announcement outlines a lot of information about councils, funding and specific schemes in place to combat the COVID-19, specifically focusing on engaging community champions to improve information dissemination about COVID-19 and vaccines. However, there is no explicit and direct call to actions for the public or reader. The only indirect call to action identified is the encouragement to community champions to work closely with their local networks and councils to provide necessary advice regarding COVID-19 and vaccines. Therefore, it can be considered as a weak call to action.
JCVI issues new advice on COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women	Moderate	The announcement encourages pregnant women to take moderate action by recommending that they consider getting vaccinated due to the higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 during pregnancy. It advises a preference for the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines due to comprehensive real-world safety data. Women are urged to discuss the risks and benefits with their clinician, however, this is presented as a decision making recommendation, not a strict mandate. Furthermore, the announcement encourages the public to take up the offer of vaccination when it is their turn, but again, this is proposed rather than enforced. Thus, the prompt displays a moderate call to action.
With UK aid support, people in Côte d’Ivoire to be first vaccinated through COVAX: Foreign Secretary's statement	None	This government announcement mainly informs the public about the steps the UK government is taking in distributing the COVID-19 vaccines across the globe, specifically in developing nations, through the COVAX initiative. There's also mention of the UK's role in a UN resolution. While it calls on other donors to increase their support, this isn't directly aimed at the general public. Therefore, no specific course of action is urged for the public or reader in this announcement.
The MHRA concludes positive safety profile for Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds	None	This announcement does not contain any explicit request or suggestion for the public or reader to take a specific action. It is primarily focused on providing information about the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 for 12 to 15-year-olds and reaffirming its safety, efficacy, and quality. The aim seems to be to increase public trust and acceptance but does not directly ask for action.
UK secures extra 60 million Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible. It does not apply strong, compelling language, but rather uses more informative and suggestive tone. Particularly, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says, "I urge everybody to get their vaccines as soon as they are eligible". This portrays a sense of urgency and importance but does not quite constitute a strong, urgent call to action.
More than half of over 18s boosted against COVID-19	Strong	This announcement strongly urges the public to take action. The phrases "All eligible urged to book and get booster as soon as possible", "I urge all of those who have not yet done so to book their booster or find a walk-in centre to Get Boosted Now", "Do not delay. Book your booster today – it might be the most important thing you do this winter", "I would urge anyone yet to book in for their life-saving booster to do so at the earliest opportunity" clearly show a strong call to action. They imply a sense of immediate urgency and importance for the public to get their booster shots to protect themselves and others against the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
JCVI advice on COVID-19 booster vaccines for those aged 18 to 39 and a second dose for ages 12 to 15	Strong	The announcement explicitly urges the public to take immediate action by getting their COVID-19 booster shot when they're eligible. The phrase "If you are eligible for a booster, please take up the offer and keep yourself protected as we head into winter" is a strong call to action, as it uses compelling language to motivate the reader to participate in their personal health and the broader public health context.
UK donates COVID-19 vaccines to Malawi	Moderate	The announcement includes an appeal to action primarily in the quotes from the UNICEF Malawi Acting Representative and the WHO Representative for Malawi. They encourage the public to receive the vaccine, though the verbiage does not seem particularly urgent or stern. Instead, it reads more as a resolute encouragement or suggestion. This makes the call to action moderate, as it guides the reader to participate in the vaccination efforts but does so in a calm and affirming manner. The rest of the announcement mainly informs on actions that the government and other entities are taking.
Oral statement on easing of coronavirus restrictions	Moderate	The announcement does contain various instances of calls to action, though they are not delivered in the most direct or compelling language. People are urged to get both doses of the vaccine, to get tested and to engage with the support options on offer. Additionally, people aged 40 and above are encouraged to respond to the NHS's call to bring their second jab forward. The strength of the call to action is moderate because it encourages public participation to an extent but does not push for immediate action with strong urgency or compelling language.
Government to introduce COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of deployment for all frontline health and social care workers	Moderate	This announcement encourages health and social care workers to get their COVID-19 vaccination, reinforcing the importance and benefits of being vaccinated. The call to action is focused on encouraging these individuals to protect themselves, their colleagues, and their patients. However, there isn't a strong sense of urgency or compelling language employed to invoke immediate action, which is why the call to action is considered moderate.
Coronavirus vaccine for UK nationals living in the Czech Republic	Moderate	The announcement moderately encourages the readers, specifically the British and other residents in the Czech Republic, to take action. This is seen in their urging of residents who are eligible for a vaccine to register for it. Instructions are given on how to register using their health insurance number, indicating that steps have been taken to address previous registration issues. However, the language used is informative and directive, rather than stirring strong urgency, which makes it a moderate call to action.
7 in 10 young people aged 18 to 29 vaccinated with a first dose	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action with the repeated call to get vaccinated. Phrases like "I’d encourage anyone to get both doses of the vaccine as soon as possible," "If you’re yet to get your jab, do not delay – get booked in," and "Please come forward for your jabs if you haven’t already" show a strong call to action. Further, it informs individuals how they can act, by booking an appointment online or calling 119, and makes clear the immediate consequences of inaction by stating the necessity of vaccination proof for entering nightclubs and large crowd venues.
Pregnant women urged to get COVID-19 vaccine following new UK safety data	Strong	The announcement provides a strong call to action, directly urging pregnant women to get their COVID-19 vaccines. Statements such as "The country’s top doctors and medical experts are urging pregnant women to get their COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible," "we encourage pregnant women to come forward and receive the vaccine," and "I urge everyone, including pregnant women, to get their vaccine as soon as they can to take advantage of this crucial protection," among others, use direct and compelling language specifically aimed at the reader. The sense of urgency and importance is reinforced repeatedly throughout the text by different officials.
New data show vaccines reduce severe COVID-19 in older adults	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public or reader to take action with moderate urgency, specifically urging those who have been vaccinated to continue practicing good hand hygiene and stay at home. While there is emphasis on the effectivity and importance of the vaccine, the call to not ease precautions even post-vaccination still forms a strong part of the message. However, the call is not made with immediate urgency or strong compelling language, thus making it a moderate call to action.
UK health ministers’ statement on JCVI advice (13 April 2021)	Moderate	The announcement urges certain public groups to get vaccinated when "...they are offered...", specifically referring to males, those in BAME communities, people with a high BMI, and those experiencing socio-economic deprivation within the ages of 18-49. However, the phrasing is relatively moderate and not excessively urgent or assertive. The announcement also suggests to local health systems to use their understanding and clear communications to promote vaccinations but stops shy of making it a strong or obligatory demand.
More than 4 million people receive first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in UK	Moderate	The announcement motivates the public to take action with clear, yet moderate urgency. Suggested actions include assisting elderly (80+) community members with their vaccination appointments, signing up for clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, and staying updated with NHS advice and sharing accurate information. Although the language isn't forceful, the directives are clear and aimed directly at the reader.
COVID-19 vaccines have prevented 7.2 million infections and 27,000 deaths	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action with moderate urgency. It suggests getting both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, highlighting it as the most important thing individuals can do to avoid spreading the virus. It uses data-backed arguments ("the staggering impact of the vaccination programme") instead of urgent or compelling language to underline the importance, making it a moderate rather than strong call to action.
Health Secretary urges G20 to protect clinical trial pioneers and recognise vaccines	Weak	The announcement mainly focuses on informing the public about the UK government's stance and actions regarding the recognition of vaccine trial participants' vaccination status. Although there is an implied call for clinical trial participants to continue their participation and for the public to trust the vaccine, these calls are largely indirect and not urgently or forcefully presented. The main call to action is to G20 health ministers rather than the public.
JCVI issues updated advice on COVID-19 vaccination of children aged 12 to 15	None	This specific announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action directly. It primarily focuses on informing, explaining, or describing the decisions and assessments of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) as well as describing the health conditions under which 12 to 15 year-olds should receive the COVID-19 vaccine. While there are implied actions for people in specific health categories, there is no direct or explicit call-to-action for the reader or general public.
Supply chain workers crucial to vaccination programme to receive jabs	None	This announcement is primarily informing the public about the government's initiative to prioritize vaccination for key workers involved in the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain. It does not request, suggest, or demand any action from the public or the reader. Rather, it is detailing the steps the government is taking to ensure the continuity of vaccine supplies. The responsibility for identifying eligible workers is placed on their employers, not the general public. There isn't any call for response or participation from the public or the reader in this announcement.
UK will provide vaccines to COP26 delegates	None	The announcement is an informative piece about the UK government's plan to offer vaccinations to certain delegates and related parties who cannot access vaccines via other means. It provides vital dates and context for this initiative, but does not urge the public or the reader to take any specific action. It mainly focuses on conveying the government's measures and plans, rather than soliciting a response or action from the reader.
Consultation launched on staff COVID-19 vaccines in care homes with older adult residents	Strong	There are several strong calls to action throughout the announcement. Both the public (specifically care home workers) and stakeholders are urged to participate in the 5-week consultation and voice their opinion on mandatory vaccinations in care homes. They're also encouraged to get vaccinated protecting themselves and the most vulnerable individuals that they care for. Besides, there is a continuous emphasis on the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccination, which implicitly encourages everyone to get vaccinated. Furthermore, it calls on those who are signaled to take up the vaccine to do so promptly.
Our vaccination programme is a national success story	Moderate	The announcement urges the public and reader to continue getting vaccinated, promote the vaccination programme, and adhere to the regulations laid out by the government to quarantine at home and combat the spread of COVID-19. However, the language used is not particularly assertive or urgent, hence the identifier 'moderate'. It mentions the need for individuals to "do their duty", and thanks those who have, but does not explicitly state that they must do those actions, rather implying it. Similarly, it calls for continued vigilance against the virus but does not strongly implore the reader to immediately participate or respond.
Three quarters of UK adults vaccinated with first dose	Strong	This government announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action. The calls to action are clear, direct, and repeated throughout the announcement. The public is urged to come forward for their second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, seek their first dose if they haven't yet done so, and attend their appointments when called. It emphasizes the critical importance of receiving both doses, shortening the interval between doses, and calls on everyone to play their part in getting back to normality. Additionally, it stresses on the significance of vaccines in saving lives, reducing serious illness, hospitalisations and protecting loved ones. Therefore, this announcement can be characterized by a strong call to action.
One dose of COVID-19 vaccine can cut household transmission by up to half	Strong	The announcement contains strong calls to action, urging the public to get vaccinated as well as to continue with the public health protocols of hand hygiene and social distancing. It is direct in its request, particularly in the phrases "I urge everybody to get their vaccines as soon as they are eligible and make sure you get your second dose for the strongest possible protection" and "I encourage anyone who is offered a vaccine to take it as soon as possible." There's also a call to act like one still has the virus even after vaccination. The use of urgent words such as "urge" and "encourage" presents a clear, strong, and compelling call to action.
All young people aged 16 and 17 in England to be offered vaccine by next week	Strong	The announcement strongly urges 16-17 year olds to get vaccinated, pointing out the newly launched walk-in site finder to locate nearest vaccination centres, the openings at GP-led local vaccination sites, the option of booking through the National Booking Service or by calling 119, and the opportunity for 'grab a jab' at pop-up sites. The government officials involved use strong, direct language, such as "Please don’t delay - get your jabs as soon as you can" and "I urge everybody else to get their vaccines as soon as possible." The urgency is heightened by mentioning the desired completion date of Monday, 23 August and the importance of vaccination before the return to school. The mention of texting eligible citizens further shows the push for quick action.
MHRA statement on expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination booster programme	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to participate in their vaccination program, but the language used is not overly urgent or compelling. The key call to action can be found in this line: "When you are called for your booster dose, you can come forward confident that the benefits in preventing serious COVID-19 far outweigh any risks." This statement is urging the public to follow through with getting their booster dose when it's their turn. However, there isn't any strong, direct language demanding action. Hence the label, moderate call to action.
More than 30 million people vaccinated with second dose	Strong	The announcement uses a direct, urgent, and compelling language targeted at the public. Phrases like "Public urged to come forward for second doses", "I encourage everyone over 23 to come forward and get the jab", "I encourage everyone to come forward for the vaccine, and for the crucial second dose when the offer comes", and "I urge everyone who is yet to receive their jab, to do so when eligible" all indicate a strong call to action. These phrases exhort citizens to actively participate in the vaccination process, emphasizing the importance of receiving both doses of the vaccine.
Over 10 million people in the UK receive COVID-19 top-up vaccines	Strong	The announcement several times urges the public to take their booster jab. The Minister of Health, Vaccines Minister, and the NHS deputy vaccination programme lead directly call on individuals to get vaccinated as soon as they can. It also instructs people to book vaccinations in advance, use walk-in centers, or call 119 to schedule their vaccination. The language used is direct and pressing, highlighting the urgency in boosting immunity against COVID-19 amidst the winter season.
All adults to be offered COVID-19 boosters by end of January	Strong	The announcement effectively uses direct and compelling language to urge the public or reader to take action. Phrases such as "People urged to get booster when it’s their turn", "we all have a role to play – so step up, roll up your sleeves, and get protected when the time comes", and "Getting your jab is the most important thing you can do ahead of Christmas to keep yourself safe from the virus – do not delay in booking as soon as you’re eligible" are all strong calls to action for getting the booster jab, targeting all eligible adults. It also actively encourages those eligible for a free flu vaccine to come forward and avail it.
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine approved by MHRA in 12-17 year olds	None	This announcement focuses on informing the public about the extension of the Spikevax vaccine's use to 12-17 year olds. It reiterates the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this age group and explains the process for monitoring the safety of vaccines. However, it does not directly urge the public or 12-17 year olds to get vaccinated or take any specific action at this point.
Prime Minister kicks off major new science initiative at visit of MHRA’s National Institute for Biological Standards and Control	None	The announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. Rather, the announcement's primary goal is to inform the public about the ongoing work and achievements of the MHRA and the NIBSC during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future plans. The content largely focuses on the performance exchange between the Prime Minister and the institution, without including a direct invitation for the public to take any specific action such as following guidelines, getting vaccinated, or participating in any initiative.
Over 40 million people receive first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in UK	Strong	The announcement strongly implores the public to get their COVID-19 vaccines, underlining the importance of participation in the immunization rollout. Statements by various government officials, such as "I encourage everyone who is eligible to join the millions who have the fullest possible protection from this virus by getting their jab when the time comes" and "The offer is open to everyone over the age of 30, so when you get the call, get the jab. It could save your life and protect your loved ones," are clear instances of a strong call to action. Emphasis is put on the urgency and benefits of getting vaccinated, pushing for immediate public action.
New cutting-edge testing centre to fast-track COVID-19 variant vaccines	Weak	The announcement contains a weak call to action as it ends with a general advice given by Dr. Jenny Harries saying that the best way to prevent the spread of variants is to follow public health advice and remember hands, face, space. However, there isn't a clear or direct call to undertake any particular activity or behavior. Most of the announcement is focused on informing the public about the government's actions and plans.
Over half of pregnant women have now had one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccines	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public or reader to take action with moderate urgency. While the government does not use strong, compelling language commanding immediate action, they still urge pregnant women who have not yet received their vaccine to come forward for their jab. The advice is specifically directed towards a defined group (pregnant women), and the announcement emphasizes the importance of this action by highlighting the increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 for unvaccinated women, along with the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.
Letter from the Health and Social Care Secretary on use of the Moderna vaccine	None	The announcement doesn't urge the public or reader to take any specific action. It simply informs about letters between the Health and Social Care Secretary and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, focusing on information rather than a call to action.
UK charities join together to boost vaccine drive	Moderate	The announcement calls for the public to participate, especially those of cohort 6 suffering from underlying health conditions or acting as adult carers, to get the vaccine. Remarks about the importance of taking the vaccine, especially from the Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock and the Minister for Vaccines, Nadhim Zahawi, indicate a call to action. Encouragement also comes through the quotes from leaders of the listed charities, who are working in collaboration with the government. However, the language used is more suggestive than demanding, hence the categorisation as a moderate call to action.
Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine: MHRA statement confirming data received	None	This announcement seems to be mostly informational, providing updates on the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's review process. It emphasizes the government's ongoing work and commitment to safety but does not request any specific action from the general public or reader. The focus is primarily on informing the public about the vaccine's status and the evaluation process.
JCVI issues advice on third dose vaccination for severely immunosuppressed	Weak	The announcement mainly focusses on explaining the importance of and the rationale behind a third vaccine dose for those with severe immunosuppression. While it does imply that these individuals should receive a third dose, and that the timing should be decided with their specialist, the language used is not overly urgent or compelling to the reader. There's no direct instruction or plea to the public or reader to immediately take the action of getting vaccinated, but more of a passive suggestion or recommendation for a specific group. Therefore, it can be considered as a weak call to action.
Update to Parliament on self-isolation rules	Moderate	The announcement encourages the audience to take action but without creating a strong sense of urgency. Actions urged by the government include getting vaccinated and following instructions on self-isolation and testing protocols. The call to action is presented in a more passive and informative way rather than an immediate directive. Examples include the encouragement to play their part to protect themselves and others and the advice for fully vaccinated individuals to take a PCR test if they have been in close contact with a positive case.
British public urged to play their part in historic vaccine roll out	Strong	The government announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate and significant action to support the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. This call to action materializes in three specific ways: helping the elderly attend their vaccination appointments and volunteering in the community ('Help out'); participating in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments ('Join up'); and staying informed about and spreading accurate information regarding the vaccines ('Stay informed'). The repeated urging, including the phrase "I urge everyone... to come forward and take on our three pledges" from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, indicates a high level of urgency and expected participation from the public.
Celebrities get back to the ‘Rhythm of Life’ in new film supporting COVID-19 vaccination programme	Strong	The announcement contains numerous direct calls to the reader to take action. Firstly, it urges the public to get their vaccines; this is done multiple times, including quotes from celebrities endorsing vaccination. Secondly, it advises those eligible and called for vaccination not to delay making their appointments. Lastly, there is an invitation to the public to watch the film, and also information about how to book or manage a COVID-19 vaccination appointment. The urgency and importance of these actions are underlined by the context, fame of endorsers, and frequency of repetition.
More than a third of over 80s vaccinated against COVID-19	Moderate	The announcement presents a moderate call to action wherein Dr. Mary Ramsay implores the public to "continue to follow the guidance that is in place to protect themselves and their loved ones". This can be viewed as moderate due to the fact that it is not demanding immediate action, instead advising the public to continue complying with existing measures to control the virus spread. This call to action, although not stating it directly, also suggests the importance of getting vaccinated. So, while it isn't a pressing or immediately urgent call, it does encourage some form of continued action.
JCVI issues interim advice on Phase 2 of COVID-19 vaccination programme rollout	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public, particularly those at higher risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19, to promptly take the vaccine when they are offered. It particularly emphasizes on groups including people aged 40 to 49 years, people aged 30 to 39 years, people aged 18 to 29 years, men, those from BAME communities, those with a BMI over 30 and those living in deprived neighborhoods. There's substantial emphasis placed on expediting the vaccine process which could suggest urgency, but the language used does not carry a tone of immediacy or compel the reader to action. On the other hand, the local health teams are advised rather strongly to give priority to promoting vaccine uptake in these groups. However, as this particular call to action is directed to a specific body and not the general public, it doesn't affect the overall label.
New JCVI advice on use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take a specific action with the statement "if you are offered a vaccine, you should take it". Furthermore, it advises those who have received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine to continue with the second dose. While it doesn't impose an immediate urgency, it stresses the importance of following these guidelines for public health benefits.
Government to provide shot in the arm for West Midlands vaccine manufacturing facility	None	The announcement does not ask the public or reader to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses on conveying information about the Government's investment in Croda to increase the UK's manufacturing capacity of specialty lipids for vaccines. It highlights the potential of mRNA technology beyond the pandemic, its impact on economy and job creations, the anticipated volume of vaccine doses to be produced in the near future, and the UK's intended role and recognition in producing innovative solutions for global health threats. The announcement essentially informs about the government's actions and plans, without soliciting action from readers or the public.
50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in UK	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action, specifically urging those over the age of 40 to get their COVID-19 vaccine. It does this by providing statistics that demonstrate the progress and positive impact of the vaccine rollout so far, such as the number of doses administered and lives saved. Additionally, two government representatives stress the importance of vaccination for ending the pandemic and saving lives. However, the language used isn't highly urgent or commanding, hence categorizing it as a moderate call to action.
Leading dating apps partner with government to boost vaccine uptake	Moderate	The announcement is classified as a moderate call to action because it encourages the public to get vaccinated but does not use strong or direct language demanding immediate action. It delivers its call through incentives offered by dating apps, suggesting that vaccination can improve users' dating lives, and through quotes from various individuals affirming the importance of vaccination. The statement "I encourage everyone who is eligible to roll up their sleeves and get the jab – it could save your life and protect your loved ones" is directly appealing to the public, but not with high urgency or forcefulness that characterizes strong calls to action.
Boxing stars champion COVID-19 vaccine as the 'best jab' of 2021	Strong	This is a strong call to action because the announcement directly and persistently urges its readers to book their COVID-19 vaccine appointments, using compelling language and leveraging the influence of well-known boxing figures. Supporters are told to get the vaccine not only to protect themselves but also their loved ones. The use of language directly targets the boxing community, likening the vaccines to "the best jab." There are multiple direct calls to action encouraging the public to respond immediately, such as Matt Hancock's quote "It’s vital that everyone books and attends their appointment when the offer comes, and to crucially come back for that second dose" and Nadhim Zahawi's words “We’ve recently extended the invite of a jab to everyone aged 18 and over. So let’s roll up our sleeves, get the vaccine and put this pandemic behind us." The announcement is very engaging, using the words "let's" to show that everyone is in it together.
Health and Social Care Secretary statement 30 November	Strong	The announcement significantly pushes for the public or reader to step up and get vaccinated or receive their booster doses with urgency, particularly in the face of the new Omicron variant. There are direct, compelling phrases such as "step up and get protected" and "roll up our sleeves and get protected when the time comes," which clearly direct the readers to take immediate action. The overall tone aims to motivate and drive readers to participate in the booster program to strengthen the collective defense against the virus, suggesting high urgency.
UK donates COVID-19 vaccines to Egypt	None	The given government announcement primarily focuses on informing the public about the UK's commitments and actions towards global vaccination efforts against COVID-19, and does not contain specific instructions, recommendations or requests for the reader to follow or any way they should respond. The statement "nobody is safe unless everybody is safe" underscores the importance of global vaccine coverage, but it does not directly implore the reader to take any specific action.
Almost a quarter of a million UK-donated COVID-19 vaccines arrive in Ghana	None	This announcement provides extensive details about the UK's efforts in manufacturing, distributing, and donating vaccines, particularly through the COVAX initiative. However, it does not ask the reader or the general public to take any specific action related to the vaccination process. The focus of the announcement is primarily on informing readers about the government's undertakings and commitments.
Consultation on removing vaccination as a condition of deployment for health and social care staff	Moderate	The announcement encourages the remainder of health and social care staff to be vaccinated, and to follow the 'Get Boosted Now' campaign, emphasizing it as a professional responsibility. Additionally, the message for the public to get the Covid-19 vaccine, including the booster, is implied through the provision of data on vaccine effectiveness and the rising vaccination rates among health and social care workers. However, there isn't a strong, direct imperative for the general public to take action immediately. The language used is more suggestive rather than being forceful or commanding.
Government agrees new deals to future proof vaccine rollout in light of new variant	Strong	The announcement prominently contains a strong call to action where the Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, directly appeals to the public saying, "when you are called forward, get the jab and get boosted". This call to action not only directly urges people to receive vaccines (including booster shots) but also reinforces that it is essential to combat the new virus variant, making it a strong call to action. It directly implores individuals to get vaccinated when they have the opportunity to do so.
Everyone working in care homes to be fully vaccinated under new law to protect residents	Moderate	The announcement from the government on the vaccine rollout in care homes does encourage readers, especially those involved in the care home sector, to get vaccinated, but it doesn't use extremely forceful or urgent language. The call to action is more implicit, emphasizing the benefits and importance of vaccination, while presenting it as an expectation and requirement for those in care home settings. Urging is expressed through sentences like "I’d urge anyone working in care homes to get their jab as soon as possible.", "We have a responsibility to do all we can... so will be consulting further on whether to extend to other health and social care workers.", and "I want to take this opportunity to urge everyone working in social care to take up the jab if they haven’t already to protect those they care for, themselves and those they work alongside.". However, there's no strong, explicit demand for immediate public action.
Government to add COVID-19 to Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme	None	The announcement does not present any appeal or request for specific actions from the public or the reader. Instead, it largely shares information about the safety measures and precautions the government is taking during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
Letter from the Deputy Chief Medical Officer to UK vaccine study volunteers	None	The announcement is not calling on the public or reader to take any particular action. Rather, it is informing those involved in formally approved COVID-19 vaccine trials about their position and rights in regard to a potential domestic vaccine certification. It's focused on providing information rather than urging any sort of action.
MHRA response to JCVI advice on COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca for people aged under 40	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action in two specific ways. With moderate urgency, it impresses upon the public that it is still important to get vaccinated when invited and asserts that those who suspect they have experienced side effects linked with the COVID-19 vaccine should report to the Coronavirus Yellow Card website. These are not overly forceful directives, hence they fall under a moderate call to action rather than a strong one.
COVID-19 vaccines have prevented 10,400 deaths in older adults	Moderate	The announcement contains words of encouragement from both Matt Hancock and Dr Mary Ramsay aimed at the public to get vaccinated when they receive a call. However, the language is not overly urgent or compelling, thus justifying a moderate call to action. The public is being urged to follow a course of action i.e., getting vaccinated, hence demonstrating the moderate call to action.
Government updates on identifying and tackling COVID-19 disparities	Moderate	The government announcement presents an urgent appeal to the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19, particularly targeting the ethnic minority groups who are reported to be more hesitant. However, it lacks strong, compelling language, instead opting for a more informative and encouraging approach, thus falling into the category of a moderate call to action. This is evident in statements like: "I urge everyone who is offered one to take the opportunity, to protect themselves, their family, and their community," and through the actions outlined to promote vaccine uptake among specific communities.
Chief medical officers to consider vaccinating people aged 12 to 15 following JCVI advice	Moderate	The announcement urges individuals who are eligible (especially those aged 12 to 15 with increased vulnerability due to certain health conditions or household circumstances) to come forward to receive their COVID-19 vaccine. However, the announcement does not use particularly urgent or compelling language. This is mostly centered in the statements of various health ministers, who encourage readers with phrases like "take up the offer" and "get vaccinated as soon as possible". The emphasis in this announcement, however, is more on the deliberation process regarding expanding vaccination to a larger group in this age range.
COVID-19 vaccines rolled out to people aged 70 years and over from today	None	This government announcement primarily focuses on informing the public about the expansion of the vaccination programme, aiming to reach more age groups and those who are clinically vulnerable. It offers an update on the status of the vaccination rollout, restating the priority groups and relaying encouraging words from public figures. However, it does not directly request or instruct the public to do anything specific, such as booking vaccine appointments, following guidelines, or doing something else related to the information provided.
Self-isolation to be eased for fully vaccinated adults in step 4	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take certain actions, albeit not with high urgency. It encourages all adults to get vaccinated, and both double vaccinated individuals and children to take PCR tests if they are close contacts of a positive case. It also encourages everyone in England to use the government's offer of free, twice weekly rapid testing. While the language is not intense or strongly urgent, it is clear and persistent in stating the recommended actions to help control virus transmission, making it a moderate call to action.
Armed Forces to set up vaccine sites in Scotland	None	The announcement solely focuses on informing the public about the actions and measures the UK government and military are taking to facilitate the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Scotland. It does not contain any direct requests for the public or readers to take specific actions related to the vaccination efforts.
Advice on phase 2 of the COVID-19 vaccination programme: DHSC statement	None	This government announcement primarily aims to inform the public about the current status and future plans regarding the COVID-19 vaccination programme. It discusses the interim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the importance of prioritisation by age, and the aims for the next phase of vaccine rollout. However, it does not explicitly request any action on the part of the general public. Rather, it seeks to provide information and ensure transparency in the implementation of the vaccination strategy.
UK moves into next phase of vaccine roll-out as government target hit early	Moderate	The announcement encourages, rather than insists or demands, the targeted age groups (notably 45-49 and then 40+) to book their vaccination appointments through the NHS booking service, and also prompts those who are aged 50 and over or are clinically extremely vulnerable and haven't yet received a vaccine to come forward. However, it does not use strong, urgent or compelling language to insist on the public's immediate action or participation, hence it's a moderate call to action.
JCVI advises on COVID-19 vaccine for people aged under 40	Moderate	This announcement encourages the public or reader to take action, although the urgency is moderate. It recommends those aged 18 to 39 with no underlying health conditions to consider an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine if it doesn't cause a delay in being vaccinated. It also asks that people who have received their first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to get their second jab, emphasizing it is vital to increase the level of protection. On another note, individuals are advised to seek medical aid if they experience specific symptoms within 4 days to 4 weeks following vaccination. While the language isn't very compelling, the implied consequences of non-compliance are serious, presenting a call to action.
COVID-19 vaccinations and care homes: programme launch	None	The announcement only provides information about the government's plan to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to care home staff, and there does not seem to be any explicit request for the public or reader to participate or take any action.
Over 70 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in UK	Strong	This announcement contains a strong call to action, as it urges the public to take immediate and specific action referred to as getting vaccinated. This is evidenced in phrases like "public urged to come forward for their first and second doses when eligible," and "I urge all who are eligible to get their jab at the earliest possible opportunity." Furthermore, the constant reinforcement of the benefits and effectiveness of vaccination serves to persuade the reader to take prompt action. The call is strong and direct, explicitly targeting individuals who are eligible for the vaccine.
4 in 5 adults receive first dose of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine	Strong	The announcement strongly encourages the public to get vaccinated, especially urging people to come forward for their second doses to achieve the highest possible protection. The call to action is direct and explicit, using compelling language to stress the urgency of the situation, as seen in phrases such as "it is more important than ever that people come forward for their jabs when eligible" and "So if you get the call, get the jab to fight this virus".
Boosters provide high level of protection against death with Omicron	Strong	This government announcement features several instances of strong calls to action, directed at the public. It directly urges the readers to get their first, second, or third vaccine doses and their booster shot, emphasizing multiple times on increasing their protection against the virus. Furthermore, specific phrases such as "please book your appointment for your first, second or third vaccine without delay" and "please get boosted now" are direct and urge immediate action, qualifying this as a strong call to action.
Young COVID patients share stories to urge others to get jabbed	Strong	This announcement repeatedly urges the young population to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It presents serious implications of catching the virus, and centers its narrative on the urgent need to get vaccinated in order to avoid such complications, repeatedly using phrases such as "please get your vaccine", "get vaccinated". It also provides information on how and where the vaccination can be accessed, compelling the reader to act immediately. The use of direct quotations from professionals and affected individuals adds greater personal and emotional impetus to the urgency of this call to action. Therefore, the strength of the call to action is strong.
UK marks one year since approving COVID-19 vaccine with Boost Day	Strong	The announcement is filled with strong calls to action urging the public to get their booster vaccinations. Statements like "encourage eligible people to get their top-up jabs to protect themselves and their loved ones", "Everyone over the age of 40 who had their second dose at least three months ago will soon be able to book an appointment for their booster jab", "I encourage everybody to come forward to protect yourself and those around you", "If you are eligible for a Covid vaccination, we encourage you to book it", "it is vital people come forward to get their COVID-19 booster vaccine", "those eligible for a free flu vaccine should come forward and book an appointment", and "We strongly encourage everyone to book their booster jab via the NHS", all of which directly implore citizens to protect themselves and others by getting vaccinated. The language is direct and urgent, stressing the importance of these actions. The event "Boost Day" is also described as a one-off event clearly intended to create a sense of urgency and prompt immediate action.
13 million top-up COVID-19 vaccines given across the UK	Strong	Throughout the announcement, there are several strong calls to action where the public is being urged to get vaccinated immediately. These directives include direct quotes from public officials like Sajid Javid and Maggie Throup who use persuasive language to encourage the population to get their booster shots ("There is not a second to waste in getting your booster jab ", "getting the booster could be the most important thing you do this Christmas"). The announcement also urges eligible individuals to pre-book their booster shots, get their flu vaccines and emphasizes the importance of vaccines with real-world data and evidence. The ease and accessibility of booking and receiving the vaccine are also highlighted as part of the call to action.
JCVI updates advice on vaccinations for 5 to 11 age group	Weak	The announcement does include a call to action aimed at parents of 5 to 11-year-olds towards the end, urging them "not to contact the NHS until further details have been set out". However, the language used is not particularly urgent or compelling, and the action to be taken (not taking action, in this case) is in response to a future development, rather than immediately. Hence, the call to action can be seen as weak.
UK donates over 4 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to Bangladesh	None	This announcement is essentially informing about the vaccine donation from the UK to Bangladesh, COVAX, the programs to tackle COVID-19, and the agreements that ensure access to the vaccine at a non-profit price. However, it does not ask or urge the general public or readers to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses primarily on government actions and plans.
Government's Vaccines Taskforce has worked "decisively" and at "great pace" to improve UK's pandemic preparedness	Weak	The announcement references the need for the public to remain vigilant and continue following safety guidelines, as mentioned in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's comment, "But we still have some way to go and everyone needs to keep following the rules to keep the virus under control". However, this is a quite general reminder and doesn't strongly urge the public or reader to take specific or immediate action regarding the vaccine, thus making it a weak call to action. The rest of the announcement broadly discusses government efforts, achievements, and plans.
MHRA approves the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine ‘Spikevax’ for use in 6 to 11-year olds	None	This announcement is solely informational and does not make any specific call to action towards the public or reader. Rather, it details the approval of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (‘Spikevax’) for 6 to 11 year olds in Great Britain and mentions the responsibility of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to advise on the deployment program. The main purpose is to inform the public of these actions and updates, but it does not explicitly urge the reader to participate or respond in any way.
MHRA issues new advice, concluding a possible link between COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and extremely rare, unlikely to occur blood clots	Moderate	In the announcement, the public is encouraged to continue with their vaccination appointments when invited to, with the call to action represented in lines such as "Anyone who did not have these side effects should come forward for their second dose when invited" and "It is still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination when invited to do so". The language used suggests a moderate urgency for the public to follow the guidelines and take part in the vaccine rollout. However, these calls to action are nestled within an informative text primarily discussing the nuanced risks of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which somewhat dilutes their impact.
More than 10 million people receive first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in UK	Moderate	This government announcement includes a moderate call to action as it encourages the public to actively participate in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. While the language used does not exhibit a sense of urgency or threat, it outlines certain responsibilities for the public in the vaccination journey. These include helping those eligible get their vaccines, signing up for clinical trials, and staying informed about the vaccination process from credible sources. The communication demonstrates the essential role the public plays in this process, urging readers to engage fully but without instilling immediate urgency or pressure.
Government asks regulator to approve supply of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine	Moderate	The announcement suggests that the public continue to follow the "Hands. Face. Space" guidelines along with other public health advice, although the language used to convey this is not particularly urgent or forceful. Most of the announcement is focused on detailing the plans and updates regarding the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine's authorization process, thus the call to action is not the primary focus.
Health Secretary and DCMO statements on JCVI advice on third jabs	Moderate	Sajid Javid, the Health and Social Care Secretary, encourages all eligible individuals to get their COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they can, to protect themselves from the virus and its adverse effects. However, the language isn't compelling or urgent, and no immediate action is required from the reader. Furthermore, no instructions or guidelines on how to get the vaccine are provided, hence it is classified as a moderate call to action.
UK signs deal with Pfizer/BioNTech for 35 million vaccines	None	This announcement primarily informs the public about the government's actions and plans concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, including contracts, booster programmes, donations, and other efforts. However, it does not explicitly urge the public or the reader to take any specific action, such as getting vaccinated or following certain guidelines. The emphasis is on the government's operations and achievements, rather than on a specific action that the public should take.
Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine: MHRA statement confirming letter received	None	The announcement is simply informative in nature and does not suggest or encourage any action on the part of the reader or the public. It outlines the procedures and standards that the MHRA will undertake to review the safety and effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, pure informational content without any request for public involvement or action.
Statement on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine following MHRA update	Moderate	The government announcement does suggest urgency in the matter of vaccination, but the language used is more informative and less persuasive. The main call to action is when the statement mentions "When people are called forward, they should get their jab." This indicates that people should take the vaccine, but it doesn't create a pressing immediacy for readers. The announcement also states individuals who have had their first AstraZeneca vaccine should receive their second dose. However, the announcement puts more emphasis on presenting facts and reassuring the public about the vaccine's safety and efficacy, hence making the call to action moderate.
The fightback against coronavirus	Strong	The announcement strongly encourages the public to take immediate actions. The points of calls-to-action include urging people to stay at home unless absolutely necessary, to accept testing when offered, and to maintain social distancing. There's specific messaging for workers and employers to get tested, especially if remote work isn't possible. The language is direct and compelling throughout, strongly emphasizing the importance of individual action in controlling the virus spread. The testing and adherence to the rules also apply to the people who have already received the vaccine, providing a clear call for continued action despite vaccination. Moreover, the repeat call to continue adhering to social distancing and prevailing rules enhances the overall strong call to action.
Valneva COVID-19 vaccine approved by MHRA	None	This announcement primarily serves to inform about the MHRA's approval of the Valneva vaccine, the process behind it, and the characteristics of the vaccine. There is no point in the text where the government implores the public or readers to take specific action related to this information. The only potential action item for the public would be to contact the MHRA, but this is presented as an option for enquiries, rather than a direct appeal for the public to take action.
June Raine: How we backed a COVID-19 vaccine before rest of the West	None	Throughout this government announcement, there is no explicit urging for the reader or public to take action against COVID-19 or take part in the vaccine rollout. The focus of the announcement is mainly on informing the public about the processes the government has taken to ensure the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and ready for use. No specific participation or immediate action from the readers or general public is asked for.
Carers urged to get COVID-19 booster now	Strong	The announcement strongly urges both caregivers and care home residents to get the COVID-19 booster vaccine as soon as possible. Direct, compelling language such as 'get boosted now' and 'come forward and protect themselves and those around them' is used to stress the urgency. There is also a clear call for the public to 'play their part', establishing a collective responsibility. Additionally, information on how to book their appointments online and that vaccination centers are offering priority access to caregivers and social care staff is given, showing a strong call for immediate action. Finally, lower vaccine uptake among the staff is specifically mentioned to encourage them to get vaccinated.
Health Secretary statement on COVID-19 vaccines for 5 to 11 year olds	Weak	The announcement casually mentions that parents can choose to take up the offer of vaccination for their children, if they want, in order to increase protection against potential future waves of COVID-19. It's a call to action but there is no emphasis, urgency or compelling language. It's more of an open suggestion to parents, thus making this a weak call to action.
Government accepts JCVI advice on COVID-19 vaccination programme	Strong	The announcement strongly emphasizes that everyone eligible should get their top-up (or booster) jabs as soon as possible. The statement "I urge everybody to get your jabs as soon as you can" is a direct appeal to the public to take immediate action, thus qualifying as a strong call to action. It uses compelling language, presenting the vaccine as the best way to protect oneself and one's loved ones, reinforcing the need for immediate action. The announcement also indicates the urgency and importance of the COVID-19 vaccination to national health.
Health and Social Care Secretary NHS providers conference speech	Weak	This announcement mentions the ongoing effort to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic but makes no strong or direct requests for the general public to take action. While it acknowledges the role that the public played in cooperating with previous measures such as vaccinations, it does not adequately urge them to continue engaging in any specific actions related to the pandemic or the vaccine rollout. The focus is largely on appreciating the efforts of the NHS and explaining government strategies and plans.
Boosters prevented over 105,000 hospitalisations, UKHSA analysis estimates	Strong	In this announcement, there are strong calls to action directed towards the public. Sentences like "so I would encourage anyone who has not yet come forward to do so as soon as possible" and "I urge anyone who’s yet to come forward to get your first, second and booster dose to protect yourself and your loved ones" are explicit urgent demands. They appeal to the audience to get their vaccines and booster shots urgently, using compelling language such as "protect yourself and your loved ones." These calls to action align with the label of "Strong."
JCVI issues new vaccination advice for children and young people	Moderate	The announcement encourages parents and guardians to have their children vaccinated if they are in the specified age groups and risks categories, and alerts the public to the rollout of booster doses for certain age groups. However, the language used is not particularly urgent or direct but emphasizes the importance of vaccination in the context of the overall public health strategy. The call to action could be considered moderate because while it prescribes specific actions, the language primarily serves to inform and depends on the reader to interpret and act on the information given.
Alister Jack welcomes coronavirus vaccine rollout to Scotland	Weak	The announcement contains a weak call to action as there is not a strong or a compelling urge for the public or reader to take immediate steps. The primary focus of the announcement is on informing the public about the vaccine’s rollout, efficacy, and its distribution process, stressing the successful efforts of government and scientific community. It does suggest that citizens should not relax their guard and continue to follow hygiene and social distancing rules, and take the vaccine when their turn comes. These aren't direct requests placed with a sense of urgency, thus it is considered a weak call to action.
Almost 80% of eligible over-75s receive spring booster	Strong	The announcement calls to action the public with strong urgency. It directly urges eligible individuals to get their Spring booster jabs, emphasizing how it significantly increases protection from COVID-19. It instructs individuals to book appointments via the NHS website, also providing a contact number for those unable to access online services. Urgent phrases such as "as soon as you are eligible, please come forward," "I would urge anyone who is eligible to come forward," and "to come forward and book in" make the call to action compelling and immediate.
UK government secures additional 40 million doses of Valneva vaccine	None	The given government announcement does not contain any direct requests or urging for the public or reader to take any specific actions related to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Instead, the content primarily focuses on informing the public about the UK Government's strategies and accomplishments, including securing vaccine dosages, creating jobs, and supporting vaccine production facilities. The emphasis is on sharing information rather than impelling any form of engagement or action from the public or reader.
Latest findings from antibody surveillance study published	Moderate	The announcement generates a certain degree of urgency by asking the public to accept the offer of the vaccine once it is made available to them and to follow the existing rules to avoid spreading the virus. The Health and Social Care Secretary emphasizes on booking an appointment for vaccination when invited and urges the public to continue following the regulations. Although this is not as compelling as a 'strong' call to action, it is not mere general advice or recommendations as seen in 'weak' call to action. Therefore, a 'moderate call to action' appears to be the adequate classification.
PHE publishes COVID-19 vaccine guidance for health and social care workers	None	The announcement provides an update on the immunization process for COVID-19 in UK. It gives detailed information on updates about various aspects such as storage, dosing, vaccination of high risk groups, training materials and potential adverse effects. The statement includes remarks from government health professionals but lacks any specific or implied request for action from the general public or reader. It's all informative and does not ask the reader to respond or take any action.
UK government secures additional 2 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to continue following health guidelines until vaccines are approved and available. It emphasizes adherence to the Hands, Face, Space guideline, and to follow other public health advices, maintaining a moderate tone without the use of forceful or urgent language. Rather, the tone is more of a persistent urging, laying stress on the importance of these health precautions.
JCVI advises inviting people on Learning Disability Register for vaccine	Weak	The announcement provides recommendations for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) supports for the NHS plan, individuals on the GP Learning Disability Register, and the prioritisation method for COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is no strong or direct call made to the public or reader to take action related to these plans. The announcement mainly focuses on informing the public about how the vaccination is expected to roll out for patients with learning disabilities. It's merely implied that the readers (those on the GP Learning Disability Register and their caretakers) take the action of getting vaccinated when invited.
Care home vaccination follow-ups	Moderate	The announcement does imply a degree of urgency and the need for action from the care home managers or anyone related to nursing homes who have not yet been visited. However, it is presented rather professionally and courteously with an emphasis on the importance of participation, hence the label of 'Moderate'. It does not possess the assertiveness and pressing language that would warrant a 'Strong' label.
Vaccine uptake among pregnant women increasing but inequalities persist	Moderate	The announcement encourages action from the readers, specifically pregnant women, to get their COVID-19 vaccination by highlighting the urgency and importance of it. It emphasizes that the vaccine provides high levels of protection against serious illness and hospitalization for pregnant women and encourages them to go for vaccination. However, it does not strongly insist or urge immediate action. Also, healthcare professionals are placed as readily available for addressing any concerns, which further provides a supportive statement rather than a strong demand.
Over half a million people taking part in pioneering COVID-19 research	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to continue to participate in research trials and vaccinations, asking them to visit the Be Part of Research website and to sign up to the NHS COVID vaccine register. However, this is not presented as an urgent or immediate necessity but rather as a voluntary action with significant community benefits. This makes the call to action moderate, rather than strong.
UK hits 30 million boosters as push continues to Get Boosted Now	Strong	This government announcement is clearly urging the public to immediately get their COVID-19 boosters. This is exemplified by phrases like "I am urging you – please, keep coming forward to Get Boosted Now." and "the single most important thing you can do is come forward for your life-saving booster jab". The language is direct, urging, and it specifically targets the public to take the action of getting vaccinated. The frequency of these calls throughout the announcement strengthens the urgency and the importance of the action they are calling for.
Leading dating apps urge users to Get Boosted Now to help find more matches for Valentine's Day	Strong	The announcement prominently urges young people to get their booster vaccines and encourages them to show their vaccine status on their profiles on various dating apps, emphasizing that it increases the odds of receiving matches. The 'Get Boosted Now' campaign along with the endorsement from various dating apps, and the statements from the Vaccines Minister and other parties such as the CEO of Match Group, and the Director of Grindr for Equality, all contribute to a very strong, urgent call to action that is directed at the readers. Additionally, the focus on Valentine's Day creates a sense of urgency, bolstering the strength of the call to action.
UKHSA updates clinical guidance on vaccinations for 12 to 17 year olds	Moderate	The announcement encourages the readers, comprised of people aged below 18 and parents of those individuals, to take action. It encourages them to accept the change in timing for taking the vaccine dose after a positive COVID-19 test and to get vaccinated 12 weeks following the test instead of within 4 weeks. Additionally, it urges these individuals to contact their healthcare providers if they experience certain symptoms post-vaccination. However, the language used is not compelling or urgent, more informative in nature which makes it fall under moderate call to action.
UK hits 12 million top-ups in record-breaking week	Strong	This government announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action in getting their COVID-19 vaccines and the booster shots, especially for those eligible. Various officials and leaders urge all eligible individuals to "get your jab as soon as possible", "come forward for a first dose, second dose or booster", "give yourself the vital protection of the life-saving vaccines", and "book in as soon as possible". They emphasize the urgency and ease of getting vaccinated as a way of personal protection ahead of the winter months and for the protection and well-being of their loved ones.
Vaccines highly effective against hospitalisation from Delta variant	Strong	There are several instances in the announcement where it strongly urges the public to get their second dose of the vaccine. In particular, Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, Vaccines Minister, Nadhim Zahawi, and Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, each state clearly how crucial it is for individuals to get their second dose and to book this as soon as they've been offered it. The language used is direct and the message is compelling; it is stated that taking the vaccine will help save lives and aid in recovery from the pandemic.
Health Secretary statement on spring COVID-19 booster vaccinations	Strong	The announcement provides a strong call to action for its readers. It compellingly encourages everyone to get their top-up vaccines as soon as they are eligible, with the comment "It’s important that everyone gets their top-up jabs as soon as they’re eligible." The statement "I urge everybody to get your jabs as soon as you can" also gives the message a strong degree of urgency. Additionally, it encourages anyone who hasn't gotten a booster yet to "come forward to Get Boosted Now." The use of direct and strong language is specifically aimed at the public to prompt immediate action.
Push to protect and vaccinate rough sleepers with £28 million government funding boost	None	While this announcement discusses actions being taken by the government to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates among homeless populations and rough sleepers, it does not explicitly urge the general public or reader to take any action. The focus, instead, lies on informing the public about the government's measures, the funding they are providing, and success of their previous initiatives. However, there's no direct call to action for the public.
Health and Social Care Secretary's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 December 2020	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate steps. This includes actions such as respecting the rules to stop the spread of the virus, participating in testing (especially if they are secondary school aged children in London), adhering to preventative measures (despite the vaccine rollout), and not adding pressure to the NHS. The announcement repeatedly employs direct commands aimed at the public with a sense of urgency and persuasion, such as "we must all play our part and stay on our guard, now and through Christmas", "don’t blow it now", "we’ve all got to do our bit", "we all have to keep acting as if we still can pass it on", and "we need to take targeted action immediately".
Over 50s to be offered COVID-19 booster and flu jab this autumn	Moderate	The announcement does encourage the public or reader to take action by getting the COVID-19 booster and the free flu vaccine when eligible and when invited, as highlighted in Dr. Mary Ramsay’s comments. However, the call to action is somewhat indirect and implicitly intertwined with the provisioning of information, and the urgency is not strongly assertive, which is why it's categorized as a moderate call to action. The announcement notably ends with a note asking people within the mentioned groups not to come forward until more information is released, implying they should wait for additional instructions.
COVID-19 vaccine authorised by medicines regulator	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to act. Firstly, there's an implicit call for the priority groups, including care home residents and staff, people over 80, and health and care workers, to prepare to receive the vaccine. Secondly, there's a more explicit call to action where Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam encourages eligible individuals to be ready for their appointments in the coming weeks, and to continue abiding by given guidelines in terms of social distancing and general behavior. While the urgency is emphasized, the language is more inviting than demanding, therefore it's a moderate call to action.
An update on the coronavirus vaccine, 2 December 2020	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take certain actions, but it doesn't strongly insist on immediate execution. The speaker pushes the public to keep following the new rules, remember the basics (hands, face, space), and get a test for maintaining control over the virus. Furthermore, the speaker emphasizes that when called for vaccination, people should respond quickly for their protection and that of their community. However, the language does not suggest any immediate or imminent consequences if these actions are not taken right away. Thus, the urgency is moderate.
Large-scale coronavirus vaccine manufacturing begins in Scotland	None	The announcement does not urge the public or reader to take any specific action. It is primarily focused on informing the reader about the progress of the Valneva vaccine, the beneficial job creation it brings, as well as the commitment and investment of the UK government toward it. It does not explicitly ask the public to take part in vaccination rollouts, follow guidelines, or perform any other specific action.

However, there's no direct call to action or encouragement for the public or reader to take any specific steps or actions in response to this news.
Foreign Secretary's visit to India: joint press conference opening statement, 15 December 2020	None	The announcement does not contain any explicit call to action for the public or reader. It focuses mainly on sharing information about the collaborative partnership between the UK and India, detailing various areas of alignment, such as trade and investment, defense and security, climate change, and education, research, and innovation. It amplifies the cooperation on producing the COVID-19 vaccine through the partnership of Oxford University, AstraZeneca, and the Serum Institute of India but does not instruct the reader or broader public to undertake a particular action.
£22.5m of funding announced in new community push to get nation boosted now	Strong	The government announcement strongly calls the public or reader to action by urging them to get the COVID-19 vaccine or booster dose. Phrases such as "Get Boosted Now", "we are calling on people to Get Boosted Now", "please play your part", "It is extremely important everybody gets their COVID-19 vaccine now", and "it’s never been more important to get vaccinated so please get boosted now" indicate a strong impetus for immediate action. The announcement also encourages people to engage with the vaccine ambassadors deployed in 21 popular areas across England, visit the vaccine centres, attend community events, and even check out the traveling vaccine bus – all of which are specific actions that the public can take. This consistent urgency, combined with specific actions, signifies a strong call to action.

This demonstrates a strong call to action.
Sir Richard Sykes appointed chair of Vaccine Taskforce	None	The announcement does not ask the public or the reader to take any specific actions.

The public is instructed multiple times to get their booster shot "as soon as possible", ventilate indoor spaces when socializing, regularly get tested using lateral flow tests, wear face coverings in enclosed spaces, and continue these practices even when asymptomatic. The health and social care secretary reiterates these instructions and strongly requests that those eligible get their booster shots quickly. Additionally, the idea of participative self-care is promoted throughout the announcement, with the public being asked to contribute to maintaining low COVID-19 levels.
Health Secretary statement on Vaccines as a Condition of Deployment	Moderate	The announcement seeks to encourage the public, particularly those working in the health and social care sector, to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It repeatedly mentions the need for vaccination to protect oneself, colleagues, and the vulnerable sections of the population. There's an underlined importance for NHS trust staff and social care workers to get vaccinated, emphasizing the role they play in ensuring public health safety. However, the call to action is nuanced and mostly implied, hence the moderate label. There is no explicitly pressure-filled language or immediate urgency specified.
People urged to get booster jabs to keep your family protected this Christmas	Strong	This announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action regarding getting their booster or second jab for the COVID-19 vaccine. This urgency is consistently presented throughout the announcement, with phrases like "Eligible people urged to get COVID-19 booster vaccines ahead of Christmas", "People are encouraged to come forward for their jabs as soon as they are eligible", "those eligible for a booster have been urged to take up the offer as soon as possible", and "please get your vaccines as soon as you can so we can keep the virus at bay". The repeated appeal to book and take the vaccine enhancing the strong call to action. Also, practical information is provided as an aid for the public to act, such as booking methods and the location finder for walk-in sites.
Latest data reinforces the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations in pregnant women	Strong	The announcement repeatedly urges pregnant women to get vaccinated, emphasizing the importance of the action for their own and their babies' health. Strong calls to action are given by Dr. Gayatri Amirthalingam, Professor Lucy Chappell, Dr. Alison Cave, Dr. Mary Ross-Davie, and Dr. Edward Morris, all of whom urge pregnant women to get vaccinated right away. The language principally addresses the reader directly, suggesting immediate action, thus representing a strong call to action.
Self-isolation removed for double-jabbed close contacts from 16 August	Moderate	The announcement urges the public or reader to take action in a few ways. These include the advice for double-jabbed individuals or under 18s identified as close contacts of positive COVID-19 cases to take a PCR test; the recommendation for double jabbed people as close contacts to take precautions such as wearing face masks and limit contact with others; and the advice for everyone in England to take up the government's offer of free, twice-weekly rapid testing, especially those who show symptoms. However, the language used is more informative than directive, hence the labeling as a moderate call to action.
Coronavirus (COVID-19): letter from Minister Eddie Hughes to local authorities on plans to protect and vaccinate rough sleepers	None	The given announcement does not contain any apparent instructions or encouragements directed towards the public or readers. The content seems to focus mainly on informing about a letter from Eddie Hughes, minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, to all local authorities in England.

Instead, the focus is mainly on describing the actions of the government - particularly the virtual seminar hosted by GCSI - and their collaborative effort to share communication strategies regarding vaccines. The seminar targets public officials from Latin America, rather than the general public, furthering the lack of a clear call to action directed at the public or reader.
Life-saving vaccination programme to hit more major milestones as new vaccine added to armoury	Moderate	The announcement urges the public to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it is made available to them but does so without immediate urgency or demanding language. It emphasises the success of the vaccine rollout and provides encouraging statistics about vaccine effectivity and public adoption. The specific call to action is found in the phrase, "when you get the call, get the jab", encouraging people to take action when they are invited for the vaccine. This call to action primarily centres around encouraging participation and following guidelines.
UK and India to accelerate collaboration on vaccines to prevent future pandemics	None	The government announcement is primarily informing the public about the collaboration between the UK and India in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the creation of a new virtual vaccine hub, and the initiatives to distribute vaccines among those who need them most. It provides a comprehensive update on the measures that are taken by both governments, but it doesn't urge or suggest the public or reader to take any specific action. The announcement is instead focused on sharing information and updating on the progress made.
JCVI provides interim advice on an autumn COVID-19 booster programme	Moderate	This announcement includes a moderate call to action, being the explicit plea for those who are eligible for the spring booster (adults aged 75 years and over, residents in a care home for older adults, and individuals aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed) to come forward and ensure they are protected. This is a direct encouragement to take action, even if it is not strongly urgent or compelling, but still emphasizes the importance of participating in the immunization programme.
Janssen publishes positive safety and efficacy data for single-dose COVID-19 vaccine	None	Throughout this announcement, the UK government is providing information about the state of the COVID-19 vaccine development and its potential implications for the UK population.

UK authorises Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine	Moderate	The announcement moderately encourages the public to stay vigilant and comply with the existing restrictions in their regions in order to help combat the virus and not overburden the healthcare system. While the message could be seen as a strong call to action, it does not use assertive language or emphasize on immediate action, which categorizes it as a moderate call to action.

Vaccine Taskforce to merge with UKHSA and OLS	Weak	The announcement contains a minor call to action, encouraging the public to keep coming forward for their COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses when eligible. However, it is a small portion of the announcement, and the majority of the text details changes in organizational structure, responsibilities, and praises the work done by VTF and UKHSA. It requotes statements from key figures, mainly focusing on describing the government's actions, hence making the call to action weak in comparison to the overall content.
How we got here: lessons from the UK vaccine rollout	Weak	This announcement does not firmly implore the public to take specific immediate actions such as getting the vaccine, following social distancing rules, or staying informed on governmental rollouts. Instead, it references the public in terms of their participation in the vaccine program and the trust built around it. However, it doesn't directly urge them to continue the behavior or action. Most of the content focuses on celebrating and describing the UK government's actions, the success of the vaccine rollout, and the lessons learned, rather than instructing the public on next steps.

The closing contact details provided are general for media enquiries and not specifically tied to a call to action.
10 million people receive second dose of COVID-19 vaccine	Moderate	The announcement urges the public and reader to get their COVID-19 vaccinations, and particularly emphasizes the importance of the second dose. It does this through statements such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging "all those who are called to keep coming forward" and Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock strongly encouraging "everybody eligible to get their jab as soon as possible". However, the urgency and directness is relatively moderate, as it isn't completely focused on the call to action, but also devotes a significant portion to inform about the vaccine's effectiveness, the ongoing process of rollout, the UK government's support for vaccine distribution, and future plans.
UK regulator approves use of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 5 to 11-year olds	None	The government announcement is purely informational instead of instructive, focusing on the approval of Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 and the rigorous safety and effectiveness checks it passed. It does not explicitly ask the public or reader to get their children vaccinated or take any other immediate action in response to the information provided.
Boosters to be added to NHS COVID Pass for travel	Moderate	Throughout the announcement, there's a consistent emphasis on encouraging the public to get their booster shots, with officials citing the benefits of being fully vaccinated, particularly for international travel purposes.

Phrases such as "I urge all those who are eligible to come forward and get boosted", "Getting a booster is the best way you can protect yourself" and "it is vital that people come forward to get their COVID-19 booster vaccine" all stand as invitations to take an important action without applying strong, immediate pressure.

It does not directly seek public response or participation.
Love Island star urges Brits to get their COVID jab	Moderate	The announcement presents a moderate call to action, encouraging the public to take action, particularly towards young people and those from ethnic minority backgrounds to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This is highlighted prominently in the statements from Yewande, the Minister for COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment and Public Health England. Additionally, the announcement provides a link to the national booking service for those invited for a vaccination, implicitly urging them to use it. However, the urging language is not as compelling or forceful as it would be in a strong call to action.
National effort to vaccinate vulnerable communities receives funding boost	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action by urging those yet to be vaccinated to protect themselves and the NHS. This is seen when they say, "Please come forward as soon as you can so we can learn to live with this virus." Additionally, the public is encouraged to listen to and trust community and religious leaders who will be spearheading the Community Vaccine Champions scheme. These calls, however, are not intensely urgent or directed with compelling language which puts them in the category of a moderate call to action.
Armed Forces to support vaccine rollout across Scotland	None	The announcement primarily informs the public about the government's actions and plans in relation to the Covid-19 vaccination rollout with the assistance of the Armed Forces.

We must all keep following the steps that make a real difference	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public or reader to take action with moderate urgency. The government emphasises criticality of participation in the vaccine programme, encourages everyone to remain vigilant and continue to follow steps to mitigate the spread until everyone is vaccinated. They also highlight the role of the Honourable members in increasing the vaccine take-up in their constituencies and encourage them to utilize the new resource for such action. However, it lacks very dire and immediate language that would qualify it as a strong call to action. Also, the announcement spends a significant portion of time imparting information and appreciating the efforts of various segments of society in the vaccine rollout, diluting the overall urgency.
UK begins donating millions of COVID-19 vaccines to countries overseas including the Philippines	None	The announcement primarily informs about the UK's efforts in the global vaccination programme, particularly regarding the contribution of vaccines to COVAX and direct shipments to countries in need.

There is no explicit encouragement or directive aimed at the reader or the general public to take any specific action.
Vaccines Minister on the success of COVID-19 vaccine programme	Strong	The announcement strongly implores the reader to take immediate action. The language is direct and compelling, particularly with phrases such as "it is absolutely vital that you get boosted as soon as you can to protect yourself and your family" and "I implore everybody to join the national mission and play your part by getting vaccinated." The goal is clear: encourage immediate action from the public in light of the Omicron variant's emergence.
NHS COVID Pass for 12 to 15 year olds for international travel	Weak	The announcement lightly suggests that the public can take action by informing about the availability of the NHS COVID Pass letter for vaccinated 12-15 year olds for travel, and mentioning how to access the service. It does not use direct or compelling language to urge action, but instead provides information about the newly available service and the travel benefits it provides.
Mortality Insights	None	The announcement is merely sharing information about the Government Actuary’s Department (GAD) analysis on COVID-19 mortality and the impact of the vaccination programme. It does not urge, encourage, or advise the readers or the public to take any specific action. The excerpt primarily focuses on explaining the areas of study and the results obtained, rather than directing the readers towards any actionable measures.
COVID-19 vaccines: further evidence of success	Strong	The announcement strongly urges the public to get vaccinated, highlighting the significant reduction in risk of serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 following vaccination. This is conveyed through statements like “The findings highlight the importance of people completing their vaccination course” and the quotes from Matt Hancock, Mary Ramsay, and Nadhim Zahawi. The call to action is further emphasized by the benefits of vaccines presented in terms of risk reduction and protection levels.
New measures to boost response to the B1.617.2 variant	Strong	In this announcement, the government strongly urges the public to take several actions due to the rapid spread of the B1.617.2 variant. They directly address the public, asking them to participate in surge testing, follow the rules, receive a vaccination when eligible, and remain vigilant. In addition, people in 15 specific areas are instructed to make sure they get a free PCR test. Further, residents are asked to follow regional public health advice and to take 2 free rapid tests per week. All these statements show an immediate need and make a compelling appeal to the public to act.
New film launched urging public to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines	Strong	The government announcement strongly urges the public to take immediate action by getting flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines. The announcement uses phrases like "those eligible for the free flu vaccine and COVID-19 booster jab are being urged to book their appointments as soon as possible", "It is vital we continue that incredible progress with all those eligible ensuring they get both their flu and COVID-19 booster injections as soon as they are invited", and "it’s important anyone eligible comes forward for a flu vaccine as soon as possible and books in their booster when they are invited". The language is direct, compelling and aimed specifically at the public, making this a strong call to action.
Defence steps up support to vaccine programme	Moderate	There is a moderate call to action in this announcement where the Health and Social Care Secretary encourages the public to get boosted to top-up their immunity and keep themselves safe. The language used is not decisive or urging immediate action but suggests the importance of taking the booster shot. The primary focus of the announcement, however, is to inform the public about the availability of the Armed Forces personnel to support the vaccine booster programme.
Temporary medical exemptions for COVID-19 vaccination of people working or deployed in care homes	Moderate	The government announcement encourages individuals working in care homes and who have valid medical exemptions to self-certify their vaccine exemption status. This is to be done by signing one of the provided forms and delivering the proof to their employers. Although the call to action is directed at a specific group, it suggests the importance of following this temporary measure until the NHS COVID Pass system is introduced. While urgency is implied, the language used is not commanding or strongly urging, hence a classification as a moderate call to action.
UK begins donating millions of COVID-19 vaccines overseas	None	In this announcement, the emphasis is on delivering information regarding the UK's planned donations of the COVID-19 vaccine to international countries and to the COVAX facility. There is no direct, explicit request or encouragement for the public or reader to take any specific action in response to this information. The main objective seems to be to ensure public awareness of the vaccine rollout efforts and the UK's commitment to assisting other countries.
New advertising drive calling on young people to Get Boosted Now	Strong	The announcement strongly advocates for individuals aged 18 to 34 to get their COVID-19 booster jabs, underlining the urgency with words such as "Get Boosted Now". The message is conveyed several times by different figures including a frontline doctor, the Health and Social Care Secretary, and the Vaccines Minister for a diversified emphasis on the call to action. Initiatives like the Snapchat filter and partnerships with various entities are also launched to engage and motivate the target audience effectively. Moreover, the informative data provided on the effectiveness of the booster doses serves to instill a sense of urgency in the targeted demographic.
Health charities back vaccines drive for those at risk	Strong	The announcement continuously emphasizes the importance of vaccination for people with underlying health conditions and carers, directly calling these groups to take action by booking their vaccination appointment through the national booking system or by calling 119. The action is advocated not only for their own protection but also for the safety of those around them. The urgency and repeated references make this call to action very strong. Examples of this include direct statements such as, "Please come forward to have the jab. It will help save lives and offers the best form of protection from this terrible virus."
Millions of people get boosted against COVID-19	Moderate	The announcement urges eligible individuals to come forward for their flu vaccine, highlighting the importance of doing so through the example of the successful COVID-19 autumn booster drive. Moreover, it advises people feeling unwell to stay at home and avoid visiting vulnerable individuals. But these calls to action are not presented with strong urgency or direct language, thus it's a moderate call to action.
Most vulnerable to be offered spring COVID-19 booster	Moderate	The announcement provides some level of direction towards action, primarily targeting individuals who are eligible for the spring booster program. Specifically, statements such as "Eligible individuals will be offered the vaccine," "The vaccine offered will depend on a person’s age and local supply considerations," and "I would encourage everyone who is eligible to come forward once the booster programme starts" suggest active participation from the public. However, the call to action is not presented with strong urgency or direct commands, so the language of encouragement and suggestion makes this a moderate call to action.
Business Secretary urges Surrey residents to come forward for vaccine after virtual visit	Moderate	The call to action is embedded in the statement, "To those who have been invited but haven’t yet come forward, please do so as soon as you can." This sentence prompts a certain part of the public who have received their invite for the vaccine to take action, suggesting a sense of urgency but not using particularly strong or compelling language.
PHE study shows three-quarters of over 70s have COVID-19 antibodies	None	This government announcement does not contain any explicit call to action directed at the public or reader. Its main focus is on sharing information and data regarding the COVID-19 immunisation programme and the effectiveness of the vaccine, particularly among older adults. There are no direct suggestions or urges for the public to take a specific action such as getting vaccinated, following certain guidelines, or any other participatory actions.
More than 137,000 people in UK receive first dose of COVID vaccine in one week	None	The announcement is primarily informational, detailing the progress of the vaccination rollout, the groups that have been primarily targeted, the number of vaccinations that have been administered, the planned expansion of the programme, and other related data. It does not directly urge or request the public or the reader to take any specific action, whether it comes to getting vaccinated, following certain guidelines, or doing anything else. Instead, the focus is on the actions that have already been taken by the government and NHS, and what they plan to do in the future.
New campaign launched urging pregnant women to Get Boosted Now	Strong	The announcement is filled with strong direct appeals for pregnant women to get vaccinated as part of the new year advertising campaign. Messages such as "Get Boosted Now," "don't wait to take the vaccine," "We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated as soon as possible," and "book in your vaccine as soon as you can" are clear and assertive calls to action. The language is compelling and the urgency is unambiguous, especially in the context of the evidence presented about the risks of unvaccinated pregnant women contracting COVID-19. The announcement uses several persuasive techniques, including testimonies and endorsements from healthcare professionals, to convince the public to act immediately.
Health and Social Care Secretary accepts JCVI advice on autumn booster programme	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to take action by getting their COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations, especially if they belong to the specified vulnerable groups. The language used is not extremely imperative or pressing, but it suggests the importance of these actions for their own protection and the reduction of pressure on the NHS. The sentence "If you or your child are eligible for a COVID-19 or flu vaccine, I urge you to come forward as soon as you are invited by the NHS." specifically conveys this call to action.
People urged to get COVID-19 boosters as almost 10 million people jabbed	Strong	The announcement contains multiple strong calls to action directed at the public. Secretary Sajid Javid directly calls on families and friends to support their loved ones in getting vaccinated. This call to action is specified as urgent, making it more immediate and compelling. Further, there are repeated instructions for people who are eligible for the vaccine to book their appointments as soon as they can and for those who are not yet vaccinated to get their first and second doses. The language used, such as "I strongly urge" and "please help," further emphasis the strong call to action. Even the mention of the National Booking Service and walk-in clinics is directed towards enabling the public to act on the vaccination call to action. Overall, this announcement definitely exemplifies a strong call to action.
Uber, Bolt and Deliveroo help drive vaccine uptake	Strong	The announcement strongly urges young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 by highlighting the multiple initiatives in place to reward vaccination. Multiple direct phrases and strong calls to get the jab are used, such as 'Young people urged to get jab', 'Once available, please go out and take advantage of the discounts', 'As cities open up, we all need to proceed with caution and ensure that all adults are vaccinated against COVID-19', and 'please get your jabs as soon as you can and grab a bargain'. This demonstrates a strong call to action directed at the public to be proactive and get vaccinated.
Health Secretary's oral statement to Parliament on COVID-19 and Plan B	Moderate	The announcement contains several lines that suggest, encourage, and instruct members of the public to take certain actions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. These include instructions to avail of the booster dose, work from home if possible, participate in daily tests if needed, follow safety measures such as wearing masks, and adhere to certification requirements at nightclubs and large events. However, the tone of these instructions is presented more as a guidance than a strong, immediate appeal.
Temporary waiver of 15-minute observation period after COVID-19 mRNA vaccines	Strong	The announcement makes a strong call to action toward the end of the text. Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed encourages individuals who haven't received the COVID-19 vaccine doses to come forward as soon as they are able to. While the text also includes elements of patient safety information and assurance provided by the MHRA Chief Executive, the key emphasis is on the urgent need to act now in receiving the vaccine, especially in light of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. This is directly aimed at the public with an urging and compelling tone, supporting the strong call to action label.
Kicking COVID into touch: rugby stars support vaccine roll-out	Strong	Throughout the announcement, there are direct and compelling calls to action urging the public, particularly the younger demographic and sports fans, to get their COVID-19 vaccine. This is evident in statements by the rugby players, health and social care secretary, and the vaccines minister, all strongly urging people to take their COVID-19 vaccine to protect themselves and those around them. Their calls to action are centered on the benefits of the vaccine, personal stories, and the necessity for fans to help keep stadiums safe and sports events happening, creating a strong sense of urgency and immediacy.
JCVI advice to mitigate impact of B1.617.2 variant	Moderate	The announcement encourages action but does not do so with extreme urgency or compelling language. It advises the public to promote vaccine uptake in unvaccinated individuals of priority groups 1 to 9, while also mentioning the possibility of bringing forward the second dose of the vaccine. Nonetheless, the language used isn't directly enforcing or pushing these actions, making it a moderate call to action.
Employers unite to encourage over a million staff to get the COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement strongly urges all UK businesses, organisations and industry bodies to promote the COVID-19 vaccination and encourage their staff to get vaccinated when eligible. This is evident in the Health and Social Care Secretary's statement, "I urge everyone to get their vaccines when they get the call so we can beat this pandemic together." There's also a direct call to action by Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who requests every UK business, regardless of size, to encourage their employees to receive the vaccine.
UK vaccine swap with South Korea in joint effort against COVID-19	None	This government announcement informs about the vaccine swap initiative between the UK and the Republic of Korea and the ongoing donation of vaccines to various nations, but at no point does it ask or suggest the public to take a specific action. The announcement is more focused on providing information about the government's actions and plans rather than urging readers to participate or respond in any way.
15-minute observation period after vaccine temporarily suspended to speed up booster rollout	Moderate	The announcement encourages the public to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to report any side effects after vaccination to the “Coronavirus Yellow Card website”. Furthermore, it recommends important guidelines to people getting vaccinated, such as avoiding leaving the centre if they feel unwell, telling the centre about their history of allergies, not driving for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, etc. Although the language isn’t overly compelling or urgent, it repeatedly calls for public participation in the response to the Omicron variant. Therefore, it's considered a 'Moderate'.
Review of measures for COVID-19 and flu vaccine programmes	None	The main purpose of this announcement is to inform the public about the government's plans and actions concerning the continuation of temporary measures put in place during the pandemic to facilitate the vaccine roll out. The announcement does not directly implore the reader to take an action, making it a None announcement.
More than 85 million COVID-19 vaccines administered in UK	Strong	The government announcement consistently urges its readers to get vaccinated as soon as possible. It maintains a strong emphasis on this call to action throughout the text, stressing the significant protective benefits of the vaccine against hospitalisation from the delta variant. Phrases like "please get both of your jabs if you haven’t already to protect yourself and your loved ones" and "I urge everybody to get their jabs so we can carry on doing the things we’ve missed" display a strong call to action. It also informs readers about the need to show proof of both vaccine doses to enter certain places from the end of September, reinforcing the urgency and need for action.
First bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine approved by UK medicines regulator	None	This announcement details the approval and characteristics of a new variation of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, but does not make any direct appeal to the public or reader to take specific action. The statement focuses mostly on providing information about the safety and effectiveness of this new vaccine, while outlining the role of various health regulatory bodies in its assessment and approval. There's no direct or implied suggestion for the public to get vaccinated or act upon this information in any specified way.
Booster bookings to be opened a month early	Strong	Throughout the announcement, the government uses strong, direct language to compel the public to act, particularly in reference to getting COVID-19 booster shots and flu vaccines. It uses phrases like "Please do not delay – come and get the jab to keep the virus at bay," "I encourage everybody eligible...to book your jab as soon as possible," and "the most important thing you can do is come forward for both your COVID booster and flu jab as soon as possible." The use of words such as "please", "encourage", and phrases like "most important thing you can do" all serve as strong calls to action intended to motivate immediate public response.
Boosters continue to provide high levels of protection against severe disease from Omicron in older adults	Moderate	The announcement encourages the general public to take action but does not create a sense of extreme urgency. It communicates the importance of both unvaccinated individuals getting their first two doses of the vaccine and others receiving their booster doses. The use of phrases like "should come forward", "priority should continue" and "I encourage everyone" suggest the public needs to participate but the language is not exceedingly forceful or compelling.
Over 600,000 people get first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine	None	This is a purely informative government announcement regarding the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the UK. The announcement does not contain any specific request or urging for the public or reader to take any kind of action. It does not ask readers to do something or change their behavior in any way. Instead, it is focused on providing information about the progress of the vaccination program, plans for future vaccinations, and details about how vaccination data is gathered and managed in the UK.
New vaccine uptake plan published	Moderate	The government announcement does not directly demand immediate action from the public or reader, rather it employs a moderate, carefully crafted language to encourage participation in the vaccination program. Statements such as "We are setting out our plan to make sure everyone is protected equally","make sure as many people as possible take up the offer of a lifesaving vaccination", and "encourage everyone to get vaccinated" are examples of this moderate call to action. In addition, case studies are presented to provide examples of how community participation can increase the success of the vaccination program, suggesting a similar role for the wider public, while not explicitly commanding immediate action.
More than 25 million people in the UK have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.	Moderate	The announcement includes a moderate call to action, directing the public to follow the current guidelines and to take the vaccine when it is offered to them. Specifically in the words of the Health Secretary, “So let’s stick with it, follow the rules, and when you get the call, get the jab.” While the language is not overly urgent or pushing immediate action, it subtly encourages participation in the vaccination program and adherence to restrictions to continue progress against the virus. The rest of the announcement focuses on providing additional information and context but does not further strengthen the call to action.
Second bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine from Moderna (Spikevax) authorised by UK medicines regulator	None	The announcement primarily informs about the new vaccine variant's approval, describing its characteristics, the process of authorization, the associated benefits and safety data, and the role of regulatory bodies. There is no direct appeal or recommendation for the public to take a specific action, such as getting the new vaccine or following certain guidelines.
JCVI advises prioritising homeless people and rough sleepers for COVID-19 vaccine	None	The announcement focuses on informing the public about the decision of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the strategy for vaccinating the homeless and rough sleepers. It outlines government actions and plans but does not explicitly ask the reader or the public to act in a certain way. Therefore, there is no call to action directed at the public or reader in this government announcement.
Uganda benefits from UK COVID-19 vaccines donation	Weak	The announcement highlights the actions and efforts of the UK Government, COVAX, AstraZeneca, and other partners in providing vaccines worldwide, particularly to lower-income countries. However, the call to action directed to the public or reader is less explicit. There are implied appeals to international community to share vaccines and continue supporting this mission. Dr. Munir Safieldin's statement, "I urge other countries to share more vaccines with middle- and low-income countries. No one is safe until everyone is safe." suggests a call for collective effort, but these sentiments are not strongly emphasized or directed at the public in an urgent manner. Therefore, the call to action can be considered weak in this announcement.
Nightlife industry joins COVID-19 vaccine push for young people	Strong	The announcement continuously implores the reader to get vaccinated, clearly stating the benefits of getting the vaccine; such as to protect themselves and others, to keep the nightlife industry open, to regain lost freedoms, and to return to enjoying the activities they've missed. Direct call-to-action phrases are used throughout the announcement, such as "get a COVID-19 vaccine", "book in for your first and second dose", "get both doses without delay" and "get both of your jabs". Important information on how to book a vaccine is provided, and it is mentioned that venues will start requiring patrons to be double vaccinated from September, giving a sense of urgency. Therefore, this announcement shows a strong call to action for the public to get their COVID-19 vaccine.
Over 7 million people in the UK receive COVID-19 booster jabs	Strong	The announcement contains direct, compelling language urging the public to take immediate action. It repeatedly appeals to those eligible for the COVID-19 booster jab to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The public is also encouraged to book their flu vaccines if they are eligible, and people who are yet to receive their first or second COVID-19 jab are implored to schedule them soon. The frequent emphasis on urgent action and the use of powerful language such as "I urge everyone eligible to get their booster as soon as they can" and "make sure to book it as soon as possible" indicates a strong call to action.
New film shows Martin Kemp as Father Christmas in vaccine drive	Strong	The announcement consistently and strongly encourages the public to take immediate action in getting the COVID-19 vaccine and booster jab. It employs phrases such as "Now go book your jabs", "Martin Kemp urges people to get their jabs", "I can’t stress enough how important it is to tick your COVID-19 booster or flu jab off your ‘to do’ list this festive season", and "I encourage everybody to come forward to protect yourself and those around you" that directly propose immediate actions to the public. Furthermore, a sense of urgency is created through points such as increasing efficiency of vaccinations considering the new variant of COVID-19, the approaching winter season, and the celebratory occasion of Christmas.
NHS and social care funding	Weak	The announcement does not contain any direct commands or appeals to the reader. However, there are subtle invitations for the public to continue support for the vaccine roll-out and to uphold faith in the measures taken by the government and NHS. The speaker has given reassurances to not delay second doses and alluded to the public's responsibility to go for their second dose. There are also indirect calls towards good social behaviour, such as people looking out for each other's mental health. However, as these calls are not explicit, hence, it gets categorised as a weak call to action.
Government accepts JCVI advice on COVID-19 vaccination programme	Strong	The announcement strongly encourages the public or reader to take immediate action. The health secretary directly appeals to everyone by stating 'we urge everybody to play their part.' The specific action called for is to receive their COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses 'as soon as possible.' This language shows the need and urgency for public participation in combating the virus which makes this a strong call to action.
Pregnant women urged to come forward for COVID-19 vaccination	Strong	The announcement strongly urges pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19, emphasizing the substantial risks of severe illness and complications for both the pregnant women and their babies if they contract COVID-19. The announcement repeatedly and directly encourages pregnant women to come forward and get vaccinated, even urging the government to prioritize pregnant women in the vaccination queue. It emphasizes the importance of the first, second, or booster vaccine doses and declares that being vaccinated is the best way to protect oneself and one's baby. The announcement also requests professional groups, charities, and local community leaders to help the efforts to raise vaccine uptake in pregnant women.
JCVI issues updated advice on COVID-19 booster vaccination	Moderate	In the announcement, the government moderately encourages the public, specifically the vulnerable populations, to take action. This includes taking the booster vaccine, especially those who were vaccinated during Phase 1 of the vaccine program, and also to take the annual flu vaccine. However, the language used isn't forceful or urgently compelling, hence the moderate label.
Amazon, Sky and Molson Coors back vaccine rollout campaign	Moderate	The announcement urges the public to get vaccinated but the immediacy or urgency in the tone is not very evident. The communication is more of a motivation or encouragement for businesses and individuals to participate in vaccination. Key phrases such as "calling on every employer in the UK to join us", "Our best chance of living with this virus safely is by working together", "Vaccines are available free of charge and from thousands of vaccine centres" suggest an emphasis on the importance of vaccination, yet it falls short of using compelling or forceful language to ensure immediate action.
First people to receive Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine today	Moderate	The announcement provides substantial information about the plans for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout with a certain focus on obedience to restrictions. The direct call to action, made by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 'urge[s] everybody to continue following the restrictions so we can keep cases down and protect our loved ones'. Here, he encourages the public to adhere to regulations, suggesting a measure of urgency for their compliance, but this call to action does not appear to be the central focus of the announcement. Hence, the call to action is considered moderate.
Summit to build global confidence in vaccines to be convened by the UK Government	None	The given announcement does not ask or implore the public or the reader to take any specific action. Instead, it focuses on the information about the upcoming Global Vaccine Confidence Summit that the UK Government will convene. There's no explicit directive or suggestion for the reader to do something specific, rather it describes the government's steps, plans, and efforts to tackle vaccine misinformation and improve vaccine confidence globally.
Letter to the profession from the UK Chief Medical Officers on the UK COVID-19 vaccination programmes	None	The announcement does not provide any specific details about what the public or reader should do. It only states that a letter has been written by the UK Chief Medical Officers about the COVID-19 vaccination programmes. Therefore, there is no call to action for the public or reader.
More than 20 million UK adults receive both doses of COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement repeatedly urges the public to receive their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they are eligible. Statements such as "Receiving a second dose is vital to ensure you have the ultimate protection from this deadly virus - I encourage everyone to book their jab as soon as they are offered it" and "It’s time to redouble our efforts on the second dose, so please come forward for the second jab as it could be a life-saving extra boost of protection" portray a strong, urgent call to action. The direct and compelling language is intended to drive immediate action from the public.
More than 80 million vaccines administered across the UK	Moderate	The government announcement encourages the public to get vaccinated, highlighting the positive outcomes of the vaccination program and the freedoms it allows, such as not having to quarantine after travel from amber list countries and not needing to self-isolate after contacting a COVID-19 positive individual if you're double-vaccinated. However, the language remains more descriptive than directive, hence the classification of a moderate call to action.
Most vulnerable to be offered COVID-19 booster vaccines from next week	Strong	The announcement contains a strong call to action, whereby the Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, strongly urges all those eligible to get their COVID-19 and flu vaccines as soon as they can.

Further, the announcement encourages individuals not to wait for a possible co-administration of the vaccines, advising them to take up the offer of each vaccine when they receive it, thereby advocating immediate action.
Uptake of COVID-19 vaccine doses soars in week before Christmas	Strong	The announcement includes several instances of compelling and direct language aimed at the public urging them to get vaccinated. Statements such as "Get Boosted Now", "it is vital to get a first and second jab", "let’s build on that momentum and ensure we have the protection we need this winter", and "I urge everyone eligible to take advantage of our accelerated programme and get their booster booked in as soon as possible" demonstrate a strong call to action. The narrative conveys urgency, emphasizes the importance of vaccination not just for self-protection, but also for the safety of others and the community at large. The announcement emphasizes the convenience and availability of vaccination appointments, promoting the readers to act immediately.
Armed Forces to support vaccination programme in Wales	Moderate	The announcement constitutes a moderate call to action, as it urges eligible people to take the vaccine. The statement, "I urge anyone eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine" is a clear instruction to the public to play their part in combating the virus, emphasizing the need for action; however, the language used is not pressing nor urgent, placing it under moderate pressure. The rest of the announcement mainly discusses government actions and plans, without demanding further action from the public.
British envoy pays courtesy visit to Prime Minister Sogavare	None	The announcement does not contain any urging for the public or reader to partake in a specific action. Rather, it focuses on providing information about a meeting between the British High Commissioner and the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, discussing the UK's experience with the COVID-19 vaccines and the arrival of the first batch of vaccines in the Solomon Islands. Some supportive attitudes towards vaccination are shown, but the public is not directly urged to get vaccinated.
UK marks one year since deploying world's first COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	The announcement contains a clear and strong call to action, urging the public to get vaccinated, specifically to get their booster jab as soon as they are eligible. Several key figures – the Health and Social Care Secretary, Prime Minister, and Vaccines Minister – explicitly urge the public, emphasizing the importance of this action in the fight against COVID-19, the newly emerged Omicron variant, and ensuring a safe and healthy Christmas. Additionally, the call to action promotes the uptake of flu vaccines for eligible individuals. The use of compelling language, the frequency of the urging, and the access to the vaccinations make it a strong call to action.
Guidance updated to allow flexibility in booster programme for most vulnerable	Moderate	The announcement uses language that encourages the public to act, without displaying a strict sense of urgency. This is conveyed when the announcement mandates vulnerable individuals to get their COVID-19 booster vaccination to increase their protection over the winter. Additionally, encouragement is also shown in the statement urging those eligible for free flu vaccines to book their appointments, indicating a moderate call for action. Furthermore, there is a suggestion for the public to book their COVID-19 booster jabs if they are not contacted within a week of reaching 6 months after the second dose. Lastly, a call to action is inferred in Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup's plea for eligible individuals to book their COVID-19 booster vaccine as soon as possible.
JCVI issues updated advice on COVID-19 vaccination of young people aged 16 to 17	Moderate	This government announcement encourages action from the younger demographic, emphasizing the importance of taking the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. It suggests that young people should be vaccinated, especially if they have certain health conditions or live with an immunosuppressed person. The announcement also advises young people on what steps to take if they experience certain post-vaccination symptoms. However, the language used is moderate in its urgency and does not insist that immediate action must be taken by all. The call to action is more advice-oriented than a mandate.
Minister for Asia visits Thailand to discuss trade and security ties and welcome UK vaccine cooperation	None	The announcement is informative in nature, primarily detailing specific activities, discussions, and partnerships affected by Minister Milling's visit to Thailand, also touching on the ongoing situation in Myanmar. However, no direct call to action is made to the public or readers within the announcement. No explicit pleas or commands for the readers to participate or respond are present.

Letter from the Health and Social Care Secretary on COVID-19 vaccination phase 1 advice	None	The announcement merely talks about letters between governmental and health officials, so it does not request or encourage the reader or public to do anything. It is focused on providing information with no direct or indirect call to action.

However, the language used is not strongly compelling or demanding immediate action. Rather, the announcement offers guidance and encouragement for parents to take necessary actions once the health professionals initiate contact.
UN HRC52: Statement on access to COVID-19 vaccines	None	The announcement does not include any statements directed at the public or the reader, urging them to take specific actions. It, instead, focuses on explaining the government's response to the COVID-19 vaccine access and distribution, as well as their commitment to enhancing global vaccine manufacturing capacity. It also poses a question to the director but does not invite the reader or the public to participate or respond in any way.
British High Commission welcomes the start of COVID-19 vaccinations in Fiji	None	The announcement does not include any explicit request or suggestion for the public or readers to take specific action. Instead, it focuses on offering information about the vaccine rollout in Fiji, the UK's support for COVAX, the efforts to provide global access to the vaccine, and the projected amount of doses Fiji will receive. There are no directives or guidelines targeting the public or the reader that would infer a call to action.
Government welcomes the MHRA review into Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine	Moderate	The announcement places emphasis on an ongoing call to action by stressing the public's responsibility to follow health guidelines even as vaccine development progresses. It instructs people to wash their hands regularly, wear face masks, and practice social distancing. However, the sense of urgency is moderated by the positive news of the vaccine development and the confidence in its deployment. There's no urging for immediate action but rather a continued endorsement of existing safety measures. Therefore, it is a moderate call to action.
First real-world UK data shows Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine provides high levels of protection from the first dose	Moderate	The announcement from the government and PHE urges individuals to continue following protection measures even after vaccination. It also motivates people to get vaccinated by highlighting the vaccine's effectiveness.

New campaign launches urging the public to get COVID-19 vaccine	Strong	This announcement uses the strong urgency and direct language connoting a strong call to action.

Phrases such as "get their COVID-19 vaccine when their turn comes," "take up the offer of a vaccine when it comes," "continue on the path back to normality," and "book their vaccine when given the opportunity" clearly illustrate the appeal to the public to be part of the vaccine campaign when offered. Furthermore, it showcases the stories of individuals who have received the vaccine, thereby giving a motivational angle for others to follow suit. The repetition of these calls across the announcement intensifies the level of urgency.
Taking steps to bring about a healthier, safer and fairer world	Moderate	This announcement doesn't directly address the public or reader with strong calls to action, but it consists several statements urging for collective action and larger-scale changes. The call to action is directed more towards member states to increase their funding and consider necessary reforms for WHO. However, a generalized appeal is made towards the end, encouraging "other vaccine suppliers to follow the UK approach". On a public level, this could imply supporting these efforts and advocating for fair vaccine distribution.
Over half of UK adults vaccinated with second dose	Strong	The government announcement actively urges the public to get vaccinated, emphasizing the need for both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for ultimate protection against the virus and its variants. This is evident in phrases like "Public urged to come forward for second doses," "I encourage everyone who is eligible to join the millions who have the fullest possible protection from this virus," and "If you’ve had one dose, please come back for your second jab when you get the offer."
