No one is safe from the virus until everyone is safe from it, so it is in all our interest to remove any blocks to access and distribution of the vaccine, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cNew Zealand supports the waiver of IP protections on vaccines as an important part of our collective efforts to address the human catastrophe of the pandemic. \u201cThe Government has been actively engaged in discussions at the WTO on the TRIPS waiver and we welcome the US announcement and look forward to taking this forward with urgency. \u201cIn addition to removing barriers to speedy access to the vaccine via the WTO, New\u00a0Zealand continues to strongly support the COVAX Facility, which is playing a critical role to ensure vaccines reach all corners of the globe. \u201cNew\u00a0Zealand has contributed $17 million in Official Development Assistance to support these efforts, and is sharing 1.668 million vaccine doses (sufficient for over 800,000 people) to COVAX for distribution to developing countries. This is in addition to our direct support for vaccine access for Pacific Island countries. \u201cWe are also working in APEC, the WTO and other fora to address other elements of vaccine supply issues including through the supply chains that are limiting the availability of vaccines regionally and globally. \u201cThis includes our collective and urgent need to address tariff barriers, regulatory restrictions, export restrictions and enable trade facilitation measures that could facilitate swift access to vaccines and their effective distribution. \u00a0 We also need to do all we can to increase the manufacture, distribution and availability of vaccines. \u201cIn less than a month, on 5 June, I will chair a meeting of all 21 APEC trade ministers. I want our region to send a united message to the world that we must get all our people vaccinated as fast as possible and that trade must be a part of the solution to avoid more human suffering and economic pain, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said.",

Teams have been working tirelessly to ensure vaccine doses have been getting to the right places to honour all existing appointments, and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. \u201dThe Ministry of Health has been in constant contact with Pfizer. The company helped secure an earlier release of the vaccines, while DHL planned a route with the quickest transit times to get the vaccines to New Zealand quickly and safely. \u201cI commend and thank everyone involved \u2013 including the wider vaccinator workforce \u2013 for their ongoing efforts to ensure people continue to get vaccinated, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOur goal is to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19 and vaccination is an important part of that. \u201d",

In addition Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand) is also working with Pharmac to secure a supply of a smallpox vaccine known as Imvanex or Jynneos, which is effective against monkeypox. \u201cI\u2019m pleased we\u2019ve been able to secure 504 courses of the monkeypox medicine tecovirimat. This medicine will be free and used to treat those who become unwell with MPX, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cWhile New Zealand doesn\u2019t currently have any active cases of MPX, and the risk of widespread transmission is low it is important we are prepared. \u201cSometimes people with the virus experience painful lesions and some people may require hospital level care. This medicine will help those people. \u201cLabour Governments have a long history of supporting Aotearoa\u2019s LGBTQIA+ and takat\u0101pui communities and I hope that this news will alleviate some worry for those who may be at risk if further cases occur in New Zealand. \u2018While most people with MPX will be able to isolate and recover fine at home, having access to this medicine provides assurance that we can assist people who could be more impacted by MPX. \u201cTreatment is just a small part of our wide ranging response in preparation for a potential MPX outbreak. The Public Health Agency and Te Whatu Ora have taken a holistic approach ranging from prevention and preparation messaging, testing availability, contract tracing and providing support to those who contract it and need to isolate. \u201cTesting for MPX can be carried out at sexual health or family planning clinic as well as a general medical practice. The test itself is just a quick swab of any lesions on your skin and/or a throat swab. \u201cWe are also working hard to secure access to a vaccine, but there is limited global supply and distribution is being prioritised to those countries experiencing outbreaks, which we currently aren\u2019t. \u201cWhile MPX is not as contagious as some other diseases, such as measles or COVID-19, it is still key that if you develop symptoms you stay home, self-isolate and seek advice. Many illnesses can cause similar symptoms so it may not be MPX, but it\u2019s important to get help, \u201d said Dr Ayesha Verrall.",

RATs can be ordered from the online requestor site or over the phone, and masks and vaccines from your local pharmacy or through your GP. \u201cAhead of summer, we are encouraging New Zealanders to take simple precautions to keep a lid on COVID-19 and ensure our hard working health workers get the break they deserve, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cIf you are eligible for a booster, get one now. If you haven\u2019t had your first or second dose, it\u2019s not too late. Getting boosted significantly reduces your chances of ending up in hospital needing care. \u201cMaking sure you\u2019re up to date with your vaccines should be the first thing on your to-do list before Christmas. \u201cWe recently extended second booster eligibility to M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples aged 40 and over, if you\u2019re now eligible then book in and get boosted before going to see wh\u0101nau or heading away for the holidays. \u201cMany people have been taking advantage of available anti-viral medications, with 4000 doses being administered each week currently. We know this has been keeping people out of hospital and reduced the impact of COVID-19 on the health system. You can get antiviral medication if you\u2019re eligible and test positive for COVID-19. In the first instance for information and eligibility criteria visit the COVID-19 Health Hubwebsiteor speak to your GP or pharmacist. As always if you need COVID-19 health advice call the COVID-19 Healthline on 0800 358 54 53 for free, any time, any day, even on Christmas. \u201cWith many people travelling around the country over the coming weeks, it\u2019s important that everyone plays their part. Get prepared now so we can all have safe as summer. \u201d Ayesha Verrall said.",

Today we get back to business. Today with our joint confirmation of the 17 May, we give our people, and particularly our industry, the certainty necessary to institute remaining preparatory steps to once more welcome visitors to our shores. \u201dCommencement of the bubble is subject to a final set of criteria being met, including airline and airport preparedness, all necessary protocols and frameworks being in place, and final sign off from the New Zealand Director-General of Health and the Cook Islands Secretary of Te Marae Ora \u2013 Ministry of Health. Further informationFull information about quarantine-free travel, including eligibility, what travellers should expect, and updates to requirements, are on:The New Zealand Government COVID-19 website: www.covid19.govt.nzThe Cook Islands Government COVID-19 website: www.covid19.gov.ckQuarantine-free travel applies to all travellers in New Zealand and the Cook Islands who meet the eligibility requirements to travel. Travellers will have to have been in either the Cook Islands or New Zealand for at least 14 days before travel. This means anyone wanting to travel between Australia and the Cook Islands would need to spend at least 14 days in New Zealand in the middle. No one should travel if they are unwell, if they are waiting on a COVID-19 test, or if they have been in contact with anyone suspected to have COVID-19. There will be no requirement for a pre-departure COVID-19 test, but travellers will have to complete a travel declaration, provide a health declaration and there will be random health checks at airports. Normal immigration rules for entry into each country will continue to apply. Travellers will need to check what that means for their individual situation. From 17 May travellers in both directions will not have to enter managed quarantine facilities. Flights will be operating as \u2018green\u2019, with measures in place through the traveller journey to keep travellers separate from \u2018red\u2019 flights in and out of New Zealand where passengers need to enter MIQ.",

        "content": "Associate Minister for Health (M\u0101ori) Hon Peeni Henare is pleased to confirm that the timing and sequencing of the COVID-19 Vaccine Programme has a strong focus on protecting M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccination programme is the largest and most intensive vaccination programme the health sector has ever embarked on and we are ensuring that wh\u0101nau are at the centre, \u201d Peeni Henare said. \u201cWe know M\u0101ori are more likely to be worse off from the effects of COVID-19. That is why M\u0101ori needs are at the forefront of the Government\u2019s Vaccination Programme. \u201cOur plan is simple \u2013 first protect wh\u0101nau most at risk of picking up the virus in their workplace, in doing so reducing the risk of future outbreaks and then protecting our elders who are most at risk of getting seriously ill if they get the virus. \u201cWe know that elder M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples are more likely to live with wh\u0101nau rather than in an aged care facility. This is why from this month we are allocating 40,000 vaccine courses to M\u0101ori and Pacific health providers to target vaccinations within the communities they service in order to reach these people. \u201cThis is a by M\u0101ori for M\u0101ori approach to this component of our vaccine roll-out. \u201cWhen a kuia or koroua go to get vaccinated, their wh\u0101nau members who live with them will also be able to be vaccinated at the same time \u2013 this wh\u0101nau-centred approach means that an entire wh\u0101nau can be vaccinated altogether and will help to keep our people safe. \u201cWe are taking a flexible and wh\u0101nau-centred approach that focuses on the protection of our kuia and koroua and those with long term health conditions as a priority. \u201cM\u0101ori health providers and communities know what\u2019s best for their people, it\u2019s important that there is flexibility in the roll out of the programme to ensure M\u0101ori do not miss out on the vaccination. \u201cWe live in large, intergenerational wh\u0101nau so it just makes sense to vaccinate an entire wh\u0101nau at the same time to ensure the best possible protection for our kaumatua and those with long term health conditions. \u201cWe\u2018re also recognising the special circumstances of South Auckland by prioritising those who live there who are most at risk of picking up or getting the virus, many of whom will be M\u0101ori. \u201cTwo of our major outbreaks have been geographically based in South Auckland. Our approach brings forward to this month the start of vaccinations for anyone aged over 65 or who has underlying health conditions that live in the Counties Manakau catchment. \u201cThis is about protecting our wh\u0101nau, hapu, iwi and our whakapapa and we are ensuring that those most at risk of getting sick from the virus are prioritised in getting the vaccine. The Government has also committed dedicated funding and resources for M\u0101ori communities to prepare for the COVID-19 vaccination programme. Initial funding of approximately $39 million will ensure M\u0101ori communities and providers are prepared for the roll out of the COVID-19 programme in their communities. An initial 40,000 courses of the COVID-19 Vaccine will be provided specifically for M\u0101ori and Pasifika health providers. Giving the providers the flexibility to best meet the health needs of people they meet with. The funding and vaccine allocation is as follows:$24.5 million for the development of community-based vaccine support services that will support M\u0101ori Health Providers to engage and prepare their communities for the COVID-19 vaccination programme$11 million to be provided directly to M\u0101ori Health Providers to help build provider infrastructure and workforce capability$2 million for iwi to deliver dedicated and tailored communications campaigns to their wh\u0101nau$1.5 million for workforce development40,000 courses of the COVID-19 vaccine as a starting point for M\u0101ori and Pasifika health providers. \u201cThis initial funding will support preparedness and readiness for the COVID-19 Vaccine Programme and the Ministry of Health is working to identify further funding requirements for delivery and roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine to M\u0101ori communities. The Ministry of Health will provide more detail about the funding provisions for M\u0101ori Health Providers in the near future. \u201cWe need to constantly remember that this is about the protection of our wh\u0101nau. My wero is to hold open korero, encourage everyone around you to think about what is important and how best we can work together to protect our wh\u0101nau, hapu and iwi. We are all wh\u0101nau influencers and we all have a part to play to protect our wh\u0101nau, \u201d Peeni Henare said.",

        "content": "The COVID-19 Protection Framework ends at 11.59pm tonight, Monday 12 September. All mask wearing requirements removed, except in healthcare and aged care facilities. Only COVID-19 positive individuals required to isolate for seven days, household contacts no longer need to. All Government vaccine mandates to end in two weeks on 26 September. Removal of all vaccination requirements for incoming travellers and air crew. Support for business and workers to continue through leave support payments. All New Zealanders aged 65 and over, and M\u0101ori and Pacific aged 50 and over, to have automatic access to COVID anti-virals if they test positive. The COVID-19 Protection Framework, also known as the traffic light system, will be removed from 11.59pm tonight, Monday 12 September, so all New Zealanders can continue to move forward with certainty, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced. \u201cIt\u2019s time to safely turn the page on our COVID-19 management, and live without the extraordinary measures we have previously used, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cToday marks a milestone in our response. Finally, rather than feeling that COVID dictates what happens to us, our lives, and our futures, we take back control. \u201cFor the first time in two years we can approach summer with the much needed certainty New Zealanders and business need, helping to drive greater economic activity critical to our economic recovery. \u201cThe most recent health advice now tells us that with the lowest cases and hospitalisations since February, our population well vaccinated, and expanded access to anti-viral medicines, New Zealand is in a position to move forward. \u201cYou will no longer be required by Government to wear a mask anywhere, except in healthcare settings like hospitals, GPs and aged residential care facilities. \u201cSome places, such as workplaces, special events, or marae may ask you to wear a mask, but this will be at their discretion and no longer a Government requirement. Please respect those who choose to keep wearing masks as a form of protection. \u201cAll remaining Government vaccine mandates will end in two weeks on 26 September. It will now be an employer\u2019s discretion as to whether they require their workforce to be vaccinated. \u201cVaccination requirements for all travellers arriving into New Zealand including air crew also ends, and the requirement to test on day 0/1 and 5/6 will now just be encouraged. \u201cOur 7 day isolation period for COVID cases will remain. \u201cHowever, the 7 day isolation period will now only be required for those who test positive for COVID-19. Their household contacts will only be asked to undertake a daily RAT test before going about their life as normal. \u201cIn short, we now move on to a simple two requirements system of masks in healthcare settings and 7 days isolation for positive cases only, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. COVID-19 Minister Ayesha Verrall also announced today a significant additional purchase of 40,000 more anti-viral medicine courses, expected to enter New Zealand in the next few days. \u201cWe are giving greater access to anti-viral medicines for New Zealanders, and have secured agreements that provide a significant boost to our supply for the long term, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cSo now, anyone over the age of 65, and M\u0101ori and Pacific people over the age of 50, or anyone who meets Pharmac requirements, can access the treatment in the early stages of contracting the virus. \u201cThis means more than double the number of New Zealanders will be able to access these medicines if they need them than previously, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cThere is no question \u2013 thousands of lives have been saved by the efforts of Kiwis. Be it iwi and Maori health providers, Pacifica organisations, aged care providers, businesses or the sacrifices of New Zealanders separated from loved ones, everyone played a part. \u201cSo today, I say again to everyone, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Notes to the editor:From Tuesday we will now move to weekly COVID reporting, similar to Australia. The current rolling 7 day average of hospitalisations is 241, the lowest since February and down from 273 this time last week. There are 225 current hospitalisations. There have been a total of 1,950 deaths, a 7 day rolling average of 5.

        "content": "Five hundred spaces per fortnight will be allocated in managed isolation facilities over the next 10 months, many for skilled and critical workers to support our economic recovery, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins and Agriculture Minister Damien O\u2019Connor say. \u201cThe Trans-Tasman bubble has freed up more rooms, allowing us to allocate more places in managed isolation for critical workers, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cIt has given us flexibility to expand our engagement with the rest of the world on a targeted basis and attract skills and people needed to drive our economic recovery, while carefully managing risks of bringing in COVID-19. \u201cWe\u2019re now at the stage in our COVID response where fewer New Zealanders are choosing to come home, which gives us the opportunity to focus MIQ more on bringing in skills to support our economic recovery. \u201cWe\u2019re consistently averaging more than 10 per cent of MIQ spaces set aside for economic purposes per month, which Labour promised at the election. \u201dAbout 500 MIQs rooms will be made available for \u2018large groups\u2019 every fortnight. These include spaces for:Around 300 RSE workers every month from June \u2013 with a total of 2400 arriving by March 2022300 specialised construction workers between June and October400 international students for arrival in June, out of the 1000 previously announced, for the start of semester two100 refugees every six weeks from July. \u201cThis is great news for the construction sector and will help us deliver on our strong pipeline of critical infrastructure work that will accelerate our recovery. It gives certainty for planning projects with specialist workers from overseas, maintains construction jobs for Kiwis and will bring new knowledge to New Zealand for employers and employees. \u201cThe Construction Sector Accord has consulted widely and it will continue to work with industry to prioritise the specific types of skills it needs. \u201cThey include civil and structural engineers, project managers and a range of specialist technical workers such as hydraulic modellers and mass transit specialists. \u201cWe\u2019ve also renewed border exceptions for shearers, rural mobile plant machinery operators and essential travellers to and from the Pacific. They will need to book\u00a0spaces through the online Managed Isolation Allocation System. \u201dAgriculture Minister Damien O\u2019Connor said the dedicated spaces in MIQ and renewed border exceptions will provide our agriculture, horticulture and viticulture sectors with the additional workforce to support our rural communities and help drive New Zealand\u2019s economic recovery from COVID-19. \u201cThe Government and food and fibre sector have been working hard to mitigate worker shortages by training and upskilling New Zealanders, but there is still the need for additional labour. \u201cThis decision should see around 2400 more RSE workers entering New Zealand in time for next summer\u2019s harvest season and pruning this winter. This is in addition to the 7300 RSE workers currently in the country, including the 2000 the Government approved to support the horticulture and viticulture industries during the recent summer harvest season. \u201cBorder class exceptions have also been agreed for 40 more shearers and 125 rural mobile plant machinery operators for the 2021/2022 season \u2013 subject to completion of sector workforce plans, a model to upskill New Zealanders and agreed wage rates. \u201dMore spaces in MIQs for targeted groupsChris Hipkins said the Government is taking a number of factors into account when allocating rooms in managed isolation. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing seasonal and strategic skills shortages, seasonal variations of when overseas New Zealanders travel home; and our international obligations, such as providing hundreds of MIQ places for the United States Antarctic Programme over the winter months. \u201cAround 20,000 vouchers will be made available in the online Managed Isolation Allocation System over the next three months for New Zealanders wanting to return home. \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 Elimination Strategy and the efforts of the team of five million have made this progress possible. \u201cSeeing early on that a strong health response is the best economic response has put us in an enviable global position and, as we roll out the vaccine, allows us to move into the next phase of our COVID-19 response, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

The rollout of the vaccine to the general population will be done in age groups as is the approach commonly used overseas, with those over 45 years to receive vaccine invitations from mid to late August, those over 35 years from mid to late September, and everyone else being eligible from October. \u201cOur vaccination programme is ahead of plan, with nearly one million doses administered and operating at 107% of target, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cFrom the end of July we will enter a new phase of our vaccination programme when we start receiving the bulk of our vaccines and are able to broaden the rollout considerably to the wider population. \u201cWe\u2019re rolling out the vaccine based on age bands because it\u2019s a simple approach most commonly used overseas and because the risk of COVID increases as you get older. \u201cWhen it\u2019s your age bands\u2019 turn to be vaccinated you will receive an invitation from the Ministry of Health to make a booking. You will get this invite either by email, text, mail or by phone. \u201cPeople will be asked to use the new Book My Vaccine online national booking tool to book their first and second doses. People will also be able to phone a new national vaccination booking call centre to make a booking if they wish. \u201cTo reach those we need to in a timely way, we will be putting in place measuressuch as mass vaccine events, work place vaccinations and vaccinations for entire rural and isolated communities all at once. \u201cThe Ministry of Health iscurrently consulting with large New Zealand businesses and Business NZ. Fonterra and Mainfreight are already lined up to be involved. \u201cJust as in 2020 we asked the team of five million to stay home to save lives, in 2021 we need the team to get vaccinated to save lives. \u201cHigh levels of vaccination will ensure we retain our hard won freedoms and proud place as one of the few countries in the world without COVID in the community. \u201cThis is the largest and most complex vaccination campaign New Zealand has ever run. We will keep making improvements as we go, but we are well positioned to ensure every eligible New Zealander will have the opportunity to be vaccinated by the end of the year, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

        "content": "New Zealand to remain at Orange as case numbers start to creep up50 child-size masks made available to every year 4-7 student in New Zealand20,000-30,000 masks provided a week to all other students and school staffExtra funding to schools and early childhood services to supports better ventilation over the winter monthsFree flu vaccine made available to all children aged 3-12 years oldReinfection advice amended. Anyone who experiences symptoms 29 days or longer after previous infection should test and will need to isolate if they test positive. The Government is taking action to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools and early childhood services, COVID-19 Response Minster Dr Ayesha Verrall and Associate Education Minister Jan Tinetti announced today. The country will remain at the Orange traffic light setting, with cases and hospitalisations remaining much lower than the peaks experienced earlier in the year. But with hospitals under pressure from flu and COVID and numbers starting to creep up again a suite of additional measures are being put in place to help reduce spread. \u201cMoving back to Red is unnecessary at the moment. We can continue to manage the virus at Orange, but are putting in place a range of additional measures to help manage a recent rise in cases, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cYesterday the seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 cases was 5,808 and there were 395 people in hospital and 8 in ICU. For comparison when we moved out of red in April the rolling average of cases was nearly 10,000 a day and there were over 500 people in hospital including 28 in ICU. \u201cHowever cases are ticking up and our health system is under pressure so we are putting in place a range of additional measures to help manage the virus over the coming winter months. \u201cThe first thing we have already announced is the extension of the free flu vaccine to all children aged 3-12 and the provision of a second COVID-19 booster for everyone over the age of 50. \u201cGetting vaccinated is the number one thing New Zealanders can do to help relieve pressure on our health system this winter. We are seeing an overrepresentation of unvaccinated people in hospital admissions so we strongly urge everyone to make sure they are up to date with their vaccines. \u201cWe are also updating our advice around reinfection and are now asking anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms 29 days or longer following their initial infection to test. Should they test positive they will need to isolate for 7 days. \u201cThis is a change from earlier advice which was that people would not need to re-test if they had tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 90 days and is based on the latest international evidence and the need to isolate quickly people with reinfections. \u201cHowever household contacts who have had COVID-19 within 90 days won\u2019t need to isolate, unless they are symptomatic. There is clear updated advice on what they should do to reduce risks to themselves and others. \u201cWhile reinfections are low at the moment they are likely to increase. The B.5 variant of Omicron is predicted to become the dominant strain in the country in the coming weeks and is a different variant to what most New Zealanders caught the first time around. \u201cWith these measures, alongside additional support in schoolsand early childhood services, the Government is stepping up our response to help reduce the spread of COVID. We always said this was going to be a challenging winter and we need everyone to play their part to help us get through safely, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said. The Government is also providing a range of measures to help schools reduce the risk of winter illness spreading. \u201cThe Ministry of Education has already secured a supply of 10 million special child-sized masks and intends to have them ready for distribution at the start of Term 3, \u201d Jan Tinetti said. \u201cThis means there will be 50 child size masks provided for every child in years 4 to 7 in schools and Kura throughout the country from now until the end of the 2022. \u201cThis is in addition to the adult sized mask offered to all school children from year 8 and up. Around 20,000-30,000 masks are already being distributed to students and staff every week across the country\u201cThe Government will also be providing additional funding this winter to encourage schools and centre-based early childhood services to maintain healthy levels of heating and ventilation to help reduce colds, flu and COVID from spreading. \u201cGood ventilation over winter can lead to some heat loss and higher heating bills. The winter energy payments will help reassure schools and services that they can balance heating and ventilation, without unaffordable energy bills. \u201cThe Government does not usually explicitly fund energy costs for services, but the COVID-19 pandemic is a unique situation. The scientific evidence is clear that good ventilation helps prevent the spread of COVID-19. \u201d\u201cIn addition the Government has already provided every school in New Zealand with CO2 monitors to help them identify spaces where maintaining good ventilation is proving more challenging, and bought more than 8,000 air cleaners to help improve the ventilation in these areas. Every school has access to more air cleaners at no cost if they need them to help supplement their approach to ventilation this winter. \u201cI want thank our teachers, principals and parents, who are doing a fantastic job at keeping infection rates down. I\u2019m pleased we are able to provide this extra support to help get through winter, \u201d Jan Tinetti said",

        "content": "Two additional vaccines secured15 million vaccine courses pre-ordered to dateVaccines will be free to the publicMedsafe processes streamlined for timelinessReadiness for largest ever immunisation programme progressing wellSystems on track to deliver first vaccines to border workers in in the 2nd quarter of 2021, with vaccination of general population in second half of the yearThe Government will purchase COVID-19 vaccines from pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Novavax, meaning every New Zealander will be able to be vaccinated, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today. The new agreements secure access to 7.6 million doses from AstraZeneca \u2013 enough for 3.8 million people, and 10.72 million doses from Novavax\u2013 enough for 5.36 million people. Both vaccines require two doses to be administered. The four pre-purchase agreements secured to date are:750,000 courses from Pfizer/BioNTech;5 million courses from Janssen;3.8 million courses from the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca; and5.36 million courses from Novavax. There are multiple types of vaccine technology that have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Our strategy has been to purchase different types of technology, to ensure if some are found in development or in trials not to be a successful option we will have alternatives available. \u201cWe now have agreements in place with four providers, covering three different types of vaccine technology and we have secured more than enough doses to cover our entire population plus the Pacific, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThe AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines announced today complement our other purchases, and are compatible with existing infrastructure and storage facilities in New Zealand. \u201cIf proven to be safe and effective by New Zealand\u2019s pharmaceuticals regulator Medsafe, they will provide broad population coverage for New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours. \u201cThis will be New Zealand\u2019s largest immunisation roll out ever. Most countries are factoring the roll out to take all of 2021 and some of 2022 to complete due to its scale and complexity, also due to production and delivery timeframes. \u201cOur first priority will be to vaccinate border workers and essential staff who are at the greatest risk of getting COVID-19. We expect vaccines to be delivered to our front line workers in the second quarter of 2021. \u201cOur aim is to then commence vaccination of the general public in the second half of the year. All vaccine roll out will be dependent on Medsafe sign off, which we are streamlining, and speed of manufacture. \u201cWe are moving as fast as we can, but we also want to ensure the vaccine is safe for New Zealanders. \u201cNever before has the entire globe sought to vaccinate the entire population at the same time. This will be a sustained roll out over months not weeks but our pre-purchase agreements means New Zealand is well positioned to get on with it as soon as it is proven safe to do so, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Megan Woods said the agreements ensure that we are invested in a range of options and that we\u2019re not putting all of our eggs into one basket. \u201cAs there are no guarantees that all the vaccines will successfully complete clinical trials, or be approved for use, this approach ensures we are able to access safe and effective vaccines at the earliest possible time, Megan Woods said. \u201cOur plan is to ensure no-one misses out, even if it means we\u2019ve purchased more than we need. It\u2019s an investment worth making. \u201cThe world of vaccine development is dynamic. While we\u2019re confident our four agreements place us in an excellent position, we\u2019re not ruling out other purchases if required, \u201d Megan Woods said. The Government\u2019s portfolio approach works alongside other aspects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy, including membership of the global COVAX Facility, which is also an avenue for securing vaccines. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said preparations are well in hand to gear up for what would be New Zealand\u2019s largest ever immunisation programme. \u201cNew Zealand has never before attempted an immunisation programme of this scale and complexity. We\u2019re putting all of the building blocks in place to make it run as seamlessly as possible. \u201cWorkforce planning to ensure we have enough vaccinators is well advanced. There are around 12,000 health professionals already able to administer vaccines and more will be trained. \u201cAnd, as part of the new National Immunisation Solution, the Ministry of Health will have an inventory management system for COVID-19 vaccines with accurate information about where they are located and the temperature in central storage facilities. \u201cThis will enable us to track and trace COVID-19 vaccines and consumables, including their expiry dates, to reduce wastage. \u201cThe Ministry has also purchased nine large minus 80 degree Celsius freezers that can store more than 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They are on track to arrive by the end of the year. \u201dChris Hipkins said the start of COVID-19 immunisation will not mean any changes to our borders initially\u201cOur border remains the first line of defence against COVID-19 from imported cases. To make any decisions around borders we need to be confident that the New Zealand population is sufficiently protected. \u201cIt means we will need information on whether the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at providing individuals with protection from contracting the virus and reducing transmission \u2013 and a gradual building towards population immunity, which will take time. \u201cOur technical advisory teams will be monitoring data from clinical trials and learning from the experience of other countries, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Minister of Health Andrew Little said eventually, everyone in the country will have access to a vaccine free of charge. \u201cCurrently, given we have no community transmission, the first group who would be immunised are those most at risk of being exposed to COVID-19. This includes the border and MIQ workforce, the COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers, and their household contacts. This will further strengthen our border, \u201d Andrew Little said\u201cThe aim of this approach is to create a layer of protection around the country to prevent any spread of COVID-19 into our communities. Officials are continuing to review the evidence, and monitor information about the vaccine characteristics, so we will continue to provide updates on the approach to sequencing as we get more information. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to start vaccinating this group during the second quarter of 2021, followed by the public, in stages, from the third quarter. \u201cWe\u2019re factoring into our planning a large number of complex and interconnected individual strands, including the safety approval process, global supply chains, as well as lead-in times to manufacture and ship vaccines in bulk quantities. \u201dAndrew Little said Medsafe has agreed to allow pharmaceutical companies to make rolling applications for their COVID-19 vaccines, which means they may submit their data as it is completed and ready for assessment to speed up the process. \u201cPfizer and BioNTech and Janssen have already started to submit data, and timing around Medsafe\u2019s approval process depends on many factors, such as the data that companies provide and whether it meets internationally agreed criteria for safety and efficacy. \u201cMedsafe has streamlined its assessment processes and is prioritising the assessment of COVID-19 vaccines over other pharmaceuticals to obtain a vaccine more quickly, but there will be no compromise on the safety of the vaccine. Medsafe will remain in close contact with its Australian counterpart throughout, \u201d Andrew Little said.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has today set out a roadmap for Auckland to carefully move out of current Covid-19 restrictions. Alert Level 3 and 4 restrictions in Auckland have helped control the Delta outbreak over the past seven weeks while New Zealanders ramped up their vaccination rates. \u201cToday, based on public health advice, Cabinet confirmed its plan to transition Auckland out of current restrictions carefully and methodically, with regular check-ins to ensure we\u2019re continuing to actively control the virus, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Step 1\u201cFrom 11:59pm Tuesday, Auckland will remain in Alert Level 3 but several key changes will occur. People will be able to connect with loved ones OUTDOORS with no more than two households at a time, up to a maximum of 10 people; early childhood education will return for all; and people can move around Auckland for recreation such as beach visits and hunting. Step 2\u201cAt step two retail will open their doors, with the usual measures of wearing facemasks and keeping up physical distancing; public facilities such as pools and zoos will open; and the number of people who can meet OUTDOORS will increase to 25. Step 3\u201cStep three will bring back those higher risk settings. Hospitality will open \u2013 seated, separated and with a limit of 50; close contact businesses like hairdressers will also open with mask use and physical distancing; and gatherings will also then extend to 50. \u201cCabinet will review each step weekly to ensure it\u2019s safe to move before confirming the next step. The wage subsidy will continue to be available. \u201cPublic health advice also sets out that schools at this stage will be able to return after school holidays on the 18thof October with the final decision to be made on that closer to the time. \u201cIn total, this phasing amounts to a careful and methodical transition plan for Auckland. At the end of these steps, we will then move to a national framework that reflects a more highly vaccinated population, allowing us the ability to deal with riskier settings such as large-scale events with the use of vaccine certificates. \u201cCabinet also agreed the rest of New Zealand will remain at Alert Level 2 to continue to support Auckland to do the heavy lifting \u2013 but the 100 limit cap on hospitality venues is removed. The requirement for customers to be seated and separated with physical distancing remains in place. \u201cToday we hit the milestone of 2 million New Zealanders vaccinated. It follows the doubling of Auckland vaccination rates over the past 7 weeks, with 84 percent of Aucklanders having had one dose, and 52 per cent now fully vaccinated. But there is more work to do. \u201cVaccines were always going to change the way we manage Covid-19 into the future, but our strategy has worked and will remain \u2013 we want to control the virus, avoid cases and hospitalisations, enjoy our freedoms, and reconnect with the world, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

Each project was allocated funding of between $200,000 and $500,000. Funding comes from the COVID-19 health system response and the National Immunisation Programme. \u201cThe rigorous selection process is a good example of the reformed health system working together to set priorities and build on the evidence-based approach we have taken to the pandemic, \u201d said Dr Ayesha Verrall.",

The Informal Ministerial Meeting with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council (ABAC) business leaders was hosted by the New Zealand Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime\u00a0Minister Grant Robertson, who is Chair of the APEC Finance Ministers' Process for 2021. \u201cPartnerships between government, business and civil society are critical to the region\u2019s response to COVID-19 and will continue to play an important role in the longer-term recovery, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cThe attendees at today\u2019s meeting discussed the importance of that recovery being sustainable and inclusive, and how economies and businesses can work together to achieve this goal. \u201d\u201cABAC members also raised the importance of responding to the region\u2019s environmental issues, particularly climate change. \u201dABAC Chair Rachel Taulelei also offered her reflections on the meeting. \u201cABAC is clear that addressing the continuing pandemic must be the top priority for APEC economies \u2013 overcoming the health crisis and using wide-spread vaccination and testing for safe and seamless re-opening of borders as a pre-requisite for economic recovery, \u201d Rachel Taulelei said. \u201cThis informal dialogue, the first of its kind in an APEC year, has been the occasion for frank discussion with Finance Ministers about what has worked best during the crisis to support communities and business, especially SMEs, and what needs to guide us as we move into recovery mode. \u201cSustainability and inclusion are ongoing challenges, which need a stepped-up response in a region that needs to learn to live with Covid. Action to address climate change and other environmental risks are necessary for a healthy planet. Some people have already paid too high a price during the pandemic, including women, youth, Indigenous people, those living in rural areas and those without the skills required for an increasingly digital economy. Their well-being needs to be a priority as we move forward. \u201cABAC Members also emphasised the importance of trade and open markets \u2013 both to spread the availability of vaccines, essential health supplies and associated goods and services and to keep global supply chains moving. Trade is an enabler of a return to sustainable economic growth in the region. \u201dThe session was an innovation introduced for APEC 2021, making best use of the digital format to bring together people from across the region for an informal discussion. \u201cThis encouraged an open conversation between participants who might not otherwise have had an opportunity to come together during the APEC year. It enabled attendees to gain a deeper understanding of the issues affecting the region and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cThe views of business leaders and the discussions at this meeting have been valuable and will feed into conversations between Ministers at the Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting in October. \u201d",

CEPI plays a critical role in supporting the global scientific community and it was a major contributor to the development of most of the vaccines available for COVID-19 today. New Zealand\u2019s membership of CEPI, and the participation of our researchers and innovators in its networks significantly improves our ability to respond to this, and any future pandemic, \u201d Megan Woods said. \u201cVaccines are the best tool to save lives and minimise the social, economic and cultural harms of this and future pandemics\u201d, says Ayesha Verrall. \u201cWidespread vaccination also reduces opportunities for new, more dangerous variants to arise, which would affect the most vulnerable in our communities. Through international collaboration, vaccines and innovations in vaccine technology and manufacturing can happen faster and more reliably. \u201cCEPI has a vital role through the COVAX partnership in ensuring the international community has equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and other essential research and innovation. Supporting CEPI\u2019s five-year plan, alongside our international partners, strengthens the global system for pandemic preparedness and response. New Zealand also provides active support to COVAX itself, contributing more than $26 million to date, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. CEPI\u2019s five-year plan includes:being able to develop vaccines for any future pandemic within 100 days of the viral sequence being identified, developing pan-coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics that would apply across COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses, andestablish networks of global vaccine scientific and manufacturing capacity that can be rapidly utilised in any future pandemic. Associate Minister Ayesha Verrall announced New Zealand\u2019s pledge at the CEPI replenishment summit.",

        "content": "Cabinet has confirmed formal Government approval for use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. Following the provisional approval by Medsafe announced last week, formal Government approval for use represents another critical step in the process of ensuring the vaccine is safe and effective for New Zealanders. \u201cThe Government is continuing to go by the book and has carefully considered the \u2018decision to use\u2019 the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as part of our nationwide programme, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cMedsafe\u2019s provisional approval was step one and \u2018decision to use\u2019 is a further greenlight on the road to our roll-out. After receiving further advice, Cabinet has endorsed officials\u2019 advice to use Pfizer/BioNTech. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve found the \u2018decision to use\u2019 process around this first application to be relatively straightforward, the Government also recognise there will be a huge amount of further detail to consider as the other vaccines in our portfolio of 14.91 million courses go through the Medsafe approval process. \u201cNow we\u2019ve reached the crucial stage of approval for the first vaccine, we are in a much better position to start having a conversation with New Zealanders about how we plan to proceed, recognising the natural questions some will have. Information campaigns will start from next week to support this. \u201cAs part of our portfolio, we have secured up to 750,000 courses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine through an Advance Purchase Agreement, and we are seeking a further small allocation through the COVAX Facility. \u201cWhen the first batch of vaccine arrives, we will be ready to go. We will start vaccinating our border workers within days of arrival and then the people they live with. People such as cleaners, the nurses who undertake health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, airline staff and hotel workers will be among the first to get the vaccine. \u201dChris Hipkins confirmed the vaccine has been assessed by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and has gained its approval for use here. \u201cAll these steps can provide further assurances to the New Zealand public that this vaccine is safe to use, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWhile vaccination of our border and other frontline workers takes place, we will continue to receive advice from officials on the other vaccines in our portfolio. Medsafe is in regular conversations with AstraZeneca and Janssen and has begun engagement with Novavax. A similar rigorous approval process is being followed. \u201cNew Zealand continues to play a role internationally and specifically with the Pacific countries participating in the Polynesian Health Corridors programme. These countries, which include the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu, will be given access to the New Zealand vaccine portfolio. \u201cThere is still a long way to go but as a country we\u2019ve made strong and significant progress against COVID-19 since it first emerged as a serious global threat about 12 months ago. The Government will leave nothing to chance to ensure that progress continues, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "Research into reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions is getting crucial support as part of Budget 22\u2019s investment in the new Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions, Agriculture Minister Damien O\u2019Connor announced today. \u201cThe sight of so many North Island communities working to recover from three major storms this year leaves us in no doubt of the need to take action on climate change. This investment is part of the Government\u2019s significant effort to shift the dial and contribute to a global response to climate change, and to maintain a clear competitive edge internationally, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cDemand for tools and practices that reduce agricultural greenhouse gases is growing both in New Zealand and internationally. Research on our unique pasture-based farming systems is the gateway to meeting that demand. \u201cWe have to attract the best minds if we are to succeed. Success will be two-fold: it will see us meet our emissions targets as a sector, and open up significant export revenue for our IP. \u201dToday\u2019s announcement includes more than $9 million to support up to 15 PhD students and 12 post-doctoral students over six years, and the development of a national agricultural greenhouse gas capability plan to ensure we can meet the increased demand for researchers. The Government is also investing up to $350,000 to build on the current research programme into methane vaccines, which trigger antibodies that suppress methane in animals. \u201cThis funding will be used to test two alternative protein production systems and if successful, could help realise a vaccine as a real option for farmers, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe are also investing $200,000 into further research on the effect plantain has on nitrous oxide emissions. \u201cThis will help us better understand the benefits of plantain and how it can be used on farm to reduce emissions. The latest investments will build on the $27 million announced last year as part of the launch of the Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions at Fieldays. The Centre focuses on reducing agriculture emissions through research and development. It is made up of the new Centre for Climate Action Joint Venture with industry and an enhanced New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre. \u201cCustomers abroad have increasing expectations on climate and sustainability. We\u2019ve invested $339 million through the Centre to help our farmers reduce emissions. In getting this right, we can become the best farmers for the world, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said.

This follows six days of Auckland being at Level 2, with seven days prior to that at Level 3, after 15 positive community cases emerged outside managed isolation facilities. \u201cLevel 2 restrictions being in place until today have allowed us to get the results of day-12 testing for the last remaining contacts of case M, who are in isolation. These all came back negative overnight, \u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThere are some remaining day-12 tests but these are for individuals already in a quarantine facility. \u201cIt also means we\u2019ve now gone a full transmission cycle since the last exposure event where we were concerned people could have picked up the virus. \u201cThe Director-General of Health has advised Cabinet he considers the outbreak contained. \u201cI know everyone in Auckland will be looking forward to a weekend with fewer restrictions, but we are asking that everyone keeps up the good habits that help us deal with cases if they emerge. That includes scanning in or keeping a record of everywhere you go. \u201cWe each have the power to keep the country at Level 1, by continuing to follow health guidelines, including vigilant record keeping. \u201cAs a Government we\u2019ll also keep doing our bit. This week the Government has:Announced the purchase of enough Pfizer vaccines to vaccinate everyone in New Zealand. Outlined how the vaccination programme \u2013the largest in New Zealand\u2019s history \u2013 will roll out. Established a new advisory group to ensure continual improvements in New Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 response. The group will provide impartial advice and assurances on the performance and settings of managed isolation and quarantine facilities, on planning for an outbreak, and on public communications and responses in the community. \u201cOur systems have improved so much over the past year, but we will keep reviewing things to make sure we constantly do better. \u201d",

That innovative approach by Pacific providers using our Pacific language\u00ad and cultural intelligence has been embraced by everyone, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. Targeted initiatives have included pop-up vaccination events, community outreach activity, a special 0800 vaccine booking number staffed by Pacific language speakerstargeting Pacific families, and vaccination buses that are targeting areas where vaccination numbers are low and where communities have difficulty accessing services. \u201cAnd, over the last year the Ministry of Health, in partnership with the Ministry of Pacific Peoples, has set up Pacific community roadshows and online fono across the country with the involvement of Pacific youth. These forums saw robust discussion about misinformation around the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine hesitancy in the community, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. \u201cWe have also ensured that we have content in the nine Pacific languages on our Unite Against COVID-19 website, and targeted Pacific content in our communications campaigns. \u201cThe Ministry of Health has also commissioned research to better understand Pacific peoples\u2019 attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccination, which helps to further refine our approach towards addressing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation amongst Pacific communities. \u201cIn the meantime, I encourage everyone in Aotearoa New Zealand who has had their first dose to book their second dose if they haven\u2019t already, by visitingBookMyVaccine.nzor by calling Healthline. \u201cWe want all our communities to be protected against COVID-19, \u201d said Aupito William Sio.",

Responding collectively is vital to accelerate the economic recovery for the region. \u201cOur region has already responded in significant ways, including removing barriers to the efficient distribution of vaccines and related goods, but there is still a lot of work to do to get through the crisis. \u201cLeaders will share information so we can continue to build on our collective understanding of the region\u2019s health response to COVID-19, and shape a collaborative economic response. \u201cContaining COVID-19 through rapid, safe, and effective vaccination; micro- and macro-economic policy settings to sustain businesses and workers; and building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable economies will all be on the agenda. \u201cI will be inviting discussion on immediate measures to achieve more co-ordinated regional action to assist recovery, as well as steps that will support inclusive and sustainable growth over the long term. \u201cAPEC Leaders will work together to get through the pandemic and promote a sustainable and inclusive recovery, because nobody is safe until everyone is safe, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Leading a regional response to the pandemic is one of New Zealand\u2019s highest priorities as APEC Chair. It has been the focus of recent meetings of Finance, Structural Reform and Trade Ministers, with all economies focused on international cooperation in responding to COVID-19 and laying the foundations for recovery. Editors\u2019 Note:APEC is home to 2.9 billion people, represents 60 per cent of world GDP and 48 per cent of world trade (according to 2018 figures). New Zealand\u2019s three policy priorities for APEC 2021 are shaped by the COVID-19 crisis and focused on bringing the region together to promote an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery. Economic and trade policies to strengthen recoveryThis priority focuses on APEC\u2019s economic response to COVID-19. It aims to encourage trade and economic policies that support openness and connectivity, and reduce friction at the border in order to to reduce barriers and make it easier for companies to trade and do business throughout the APEC region. Increasing inclusion and sustainability for recoveryThis priority acknowledges the need for APEC\u2019s long-term response to COVID-19 to be sustainable and inclusive of all people. It is about enhancing the participation of groups such as women and indigenous people in the economy, and ensuring their contributions are valued. It will also ensure the region\u2019s recovery can be used to improve sustainability outcomes, including in the area of climate change. Pursuing innovation, and a digitally enabled recoveryThe priority focuses on APEC taking advantage of innovation in the digital space to improve the way business is done and make it more efficient and adaptable. It aims to encourage APEC members to embrace open and competitive markets for new technologies. There have been over 50 million cases of COVID-19 within APEC\u2019s borders, with over one million deaths. The region has registered more than 100,000 new cases every day since November 2020 and, during this time, more than 22 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty. APEC-wide GDP contracted by 1.9 percent in 2020, the biggest fall since World War Two. While economic growth is recovering, around 81 million jobs have been lost due to the pandemic.",

        "content": "Businesses and events will be set for summer, with the free NZ Pass Verifier app to scan and verify My Vaccine Passes now available to download, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said today. \u201cNew Zealand will move into the traffic light system (COVID-19 Protection Framework) from Friday 3 December, and the release of the NZ Pass Verifier app is another step for businesses and organisations to prepare for this next phase in our COVID response, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe app helps give business certainty that they can quickly manage vaccine certificates and make sure they can easily check that their customers are all fully vaccinated. \u201dThe NZ Verifier app can be downloaded from the Apple and Google Play app stores today. \u201cThe app is ideal for any organisation that needs to verify customers\u2019 vaccination status. Hospitality venues, close-contact businesses, large gatherings, events, air transport and gyms are just some of the types of businesses that will need to verify customer\u2019s vaccination status if they wish to operate in higher risk levels under the COVID-19 Protection Framework. \u201cFor customers entering a business requiring proof of vaccination status, their My Vaccine Pass will be scanned by the verifier app. The verifier will show a green tick recognising the official QR code that is embedded into the customer\u2019s pass. \u201cIt will show quickly that the person is fully vaccinated or has the appropriate exemption and can enter their premises. Importantly, the verifier app does not store a person\u2019s data or see any information other than a person\u2019s name and date of birth. \u201cTechnical guidancefor NZ Pass Verifier is available on the Ministry of Health website and additionalguidancefor businesses using the verifier under the COVID Protection Framework will be out later this week. People will also be able to call 0800 800606 for assistance. \u201cFurther work is being undertaken to accommodate events that expect large volumes of people at a time \u2013 such as stadiums, festivals, or large tourism operators. \u201cEarlier this month, the Ministry published technical specifications for My Vaccine Pass and its verification. Some companies will integrate the technology into existing digital journeys or pre-verification ticketing processes. \u201cEssential services such as supermarkets, access to health and disability services and primary and secondary education facilities cannot ask for proof of verification status and will not require a NZ Pass Verifier. \u201cAs My Vaccine Pass and its verification become part of everyday habits, we\u2019re also asking people to keep using the tools we already have in place to protect us from COVID-19. Mask up, keep your distance and use your COVID Tracer app, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cNearly 1.4 million My Vaccine Passes have been generated so far. For those who haven\u2019t taken the step yet, we encourage you to do so. \u201cThis week we\u2019re also publicising sector guidance for businesses to successfully transition to the traffic light system. \u201d",

        "content": "South Island regions hardest hit by the closure of international borders are the focus of a visit by Tourism and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash over the next two days. Mr Nash will visit Southland and Central Otago to discuss challenges facing regional economies. He will travel to Te Anau, Invercargill, Queenstown, Arrowtown and Cromwell. \u201cI would like to hear first-hand from local mayors and councillors, small businesses, employers, community organisations and iwi about how they are responding to the impact of closed borders, \u201d Mr Nash said. \u201cI also would like updates on the roll out of tourism support and infrastructure investment from the Tourism Recovery Package, Provincial Growth Fund and other sources. \u201cI have been upfront that mass-scale international tourism is unlikely before 2022, but we are working hard to open a Trans-Tasman bubble as soon as we can in 2021. \u201cWe have never stopped working on the issue of the trans-Tasman bubble. Although we have had community cases here, and there have been community outbreaks in Australia which have slowed things down, the work has never stopped. We remain committed to it. \u201cWe are on-track to vaccinate the majority of Kiwis against COVID19 by the end of this year, after the deal to purchase extra doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Mass vaccination against COVID19 is a crucial step for our tourism industry and wider economy. \u201cIt reinforces our approach from the very beginning of the global pandemic, which was to emphasise a strong health response as the best economic response. \u201cWe responded immediately with a $400 million dollar support package for tourism last year. Wider support through wage subsidies, resurgence payments, and interest-free loans are also available. Background for EditorsEconomic support in Southland:Under theTourism Recovery Package, eleven tourism businesses in Fiordland, Stewart Island and Invercargill received $5.5million in cash grants, as well as multi-million dollar concessionary loan offers that are interest-free and don\u2019t require repayment for two years. In addition, destination marketing agencies received $1.95 million to promote domestic tourism and events in Southland and Fiordland. *In infrastructure and regional economic development, approximately 47 Southland projects have received $90 million from theProvincial Development Unit(MBIE). This helps diversify regional economies that rely heavily on international tourism. Projects include big-ticket items, like:$22 million for the Milford Highway Fibre Connection$19.5 million for an inner-city regeneration project in Invercargill$8 million for a salmon hatchery at Bluff$1.9 million in forestry grants$500,000 for Invercargill airport terminal developmentThere are also a number of smaller projects under $0.5 million that nevertheless are important for community resilience and local pride, like restoration of community halls, war memorials, marae and churches. Economic support in Queenstown Lakes-Central Otago:Under the Tourism Recovery Package (TRG), 27 businesses in the Otago region, most of them around the Lakes, received $17.46million in cash grants. Separate multi-million dollar concessionary loan offers are interest-free and don\u2019t need repayment for two years. In addition, destination marketing agencies received a further $2.4million to promote domestic tourism and events in Queenstown, Wanaka, and Central Otago. *Outside the TRG, approximately 60 infrastructure and regional economic development projects in Otago are receiving $98 million from theProvincial Development Unit(MBIE). This will help diversify regional economies and create new jobs. Infrastructure projects include:$6.5million for the Clutha Gold Cycle Trail$2million for seismic strengthening of the Lakes District Museum at Arrowtown$1.2million to upgrade community halls in the Queenstown Lakes District$8million for upgrades to the SH6/SH8b intersection at Cromwell* Tourism businesses supported inSouthlandare: Doubtful Sound Cruises; Fiordland Expeditions; JUCY Cruise; Milford Sound Tourism; Real Journeys Milford Sound; Stewart Island Ferry Service; Te Anau Glowworm Caves; Te Anau Helicopter Services; Transport World; Air Milford; Southern Discoveries.

New Zealand secured 7.6 million doses (enough for 3.8 million people) of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine through an advance purchase agreement with the company last year. \u201cThe AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is one of four purchase agreements we have with pharmaceutical companies for COVID-19 vaccines. We took a portfolio approach to manage the risk that some vaccines might not complete trials or be approved for use in New Zealand, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cWe are in a fortunate position to now have three vaccines receive provisional approval. Cabinet is yet to consider whether to use the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in New Zealand. \u201cHowever this is an important step towards enabling the donation of AstraZeneca from New Zealand to Pacific countries, where we have made commitments. \u201dThe AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine requires two doses and is stored at normal fridge temperatures (2 to 8 degrees Celsius). The first delivery could be as early as late August, and officials are working closely with AstraZeneca to confirm delivery schedules. \u201cOur immunisation plan in New Zealand remains focused on rolling out the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The workforce is ramping up in line with increased deliveries. \u201cWe are on track to provide two doses of the Pfizer vaccines to everyone in New Zealand who wishes to have one, by the end of this year. No one will miss out, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said.",

        "content": "Booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine will start being administered from 29 November, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today. \u201cMedsafe has already approved use of Pfizer as a booster for people who are 18 years or older, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cFollowing further advice to Cabinet from the vaccine technical advisory group, today I\u2019m announcing that the vaccination programme will start administering booster doses from 29 November. \u201cVaccination is the best protection against COVID-19. Booster doses will be available free for anyone in New Zealand aged 18 or older who has completed their two dose course more than six months ago. \u201cAnd, people will be able to access boosters in New Zealand, whether they received their earlier doses here or overseas. \u201cI\u2019m also confirming that the Pfizer vaccine will be used for boosters, regardless of which vaccine was used for earlier doses. It\u2019s the same Pfizer vaccine used for the first two doses in the vaccination rollout. \u201cWhile most other countries are rationing boosters to certain groups, we have made the decision to make boosters available to everyone. That ensures simplicity and equity. \u201cPeople are eligible to take up the offer of a booster once six months have passed since their second dose, but there\u2019s no need to rush to get the booster. The science shows fully vaccinated people remain really well protected from infection, and from being seriously ill if they do get COVID-19. \u201cOur healthcare and border workers are a priority group for booster vaccine doses because they\u2019re on the front line against COVID-19 and because large numbers of them completed their vaccine course six months or longer ago. We will also be making sure older people including people in residential care have good access to booster doses when they become eligible. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly keen to make sure those groups are aware that the booster programme is about to kick off, and that they\u2019re eligible. \u201cThere are currently 144,000 people in New Zealand who have been vaccinated for six months and 455,847 who will be by the end of the year. \u201dChris Hipkins added that New Zealanders topping up their personal armour against COVID-19 with one of the most highly effective vaccines available has another benefit. It will also support the Protection Framework when this replaces the Alert Level system. \u201cCombining the Protection Framework with the booster programme will reduce the risk of severe disease caused by COVID-19, reduce the burden on hospitals and other healthcare providers, and protect those at high occupational risk of exposure. \u201cAnd it will give us even greater confidence that, as we transition to a world where we\u2019re freer to move, live and work with less disruption, we can remain protected from Delta. \u201cOf course, we also need to remember to keep on with the other simple steps for staying safe, such as distancing, using face coverings, scanning and staying at home if sick. \u201cI also want to stress that while the booster programme is an exciting next step in our pandemic response, increasingthe vaccination coverage of first and second doses, particularly for M\u0101ori and Pacific people, remains the Government\u2019s number one priority in our nationwide vaccination rollout. \u201cPleaseencourage your wh\u0101nau and friends to get vaccinated. \u201dKey points:Vaccination clinics, pharmacies and GPs will provide booster doses from the end of November. You will be able use thebook my vaccine websiteto\u00a0book\u00a0a free booster vaccine dose from 26 November. Boosters are strongly recommended for anyone who has had their second dose at least six months ago. Booster doses are not currently required for the public to get a vaccine certificate for access to events, gyms, churches, hairdressers, and other services and premises. For people who are immuno-suppressed and receiving a third dose of Pfizer as part of their primary vaccinations, they will need to wait at least six months after the third dose.",

We can further support them to connect with those harder to reach people, while removing barriers to vaccination that exist, \u201dPriyanca Radhakrishnan said. \u201cCommunities have told us that being able to provide things like transport, interpreters, collateral and venue hire would make a real difference. This new Vaccine Uptake Fund will pay for this sort of activity and make it easier for people to get vaccinated. \u201dThe new $1 million Vaccine Uptake Fund is in addition to the$2 million for theEthnic Communities Communications Fundwhich supported 71 initiatives across a broad range of communities throughout the country. \u201cThe Ethnic Communities Communications Fund had a huge response, and as a result the funding was doubled from $1 million to $2 million to help boost vaccination rates among our ethnic communities, \u201dPriyanca Radhakrishnan said. Successful initiatives focused on translation services, educational and community wellbeing. The initiatives will support doctors, medical professionals, respected community, youth, and faith-based leaders from a range of ethnic communities to engage through online community health forums, educational workshops, videos, and social media platforms focused on the vaccination journey. Misinformation about vaccines from other countries is an issue for some ethnic communities and will be addressed through initiatives using community forums, videos, social media platforms and radio broadcasts. \u201cNew Zealand is a diverse country with over 213 ethnic communities represented who collectively speak over 160 languages, have varied needs, and may access information differently, \u201d Priyanca Radhakrishnan said. \u201cEthnic community organisations understand these diverse needs and are best placed to reach those who need a little additional support to get vaccinated. These two funds are and will continue to support them to be able to do this effectively. \u201cI encourage all community organisations who require further support to get vaccination rates as high as possible within our ethnic communities to make an application to the Vaccine Uptake Fund. \u201dFunding for both funds has been provided by the Ministry of Health and was set up in partnership with the Ministry for Ethnic Communities. Community organisations and individuals can apply for funding now at theMinistry for Ethnic Communities website.",

        "content": "People who are fully vaccinated will now spend less time isolating if they get COVID-19 or are a close contact of a case. Contact tracing categories have changed to reflect the vaccination status of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the community, and others who may have been exposed to them. The isolation period for fully vaccinated COVID-19 cases in the community has been reduced from 14 days to 10 days, and must include 72 hours symptom-free. The isolation period for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated COVID-19 cases will remain 14 days, including 72 hours symptom-free. \u201cIf you are vaccinated and catch COVID-19, by day 10 of infection you will pose a very low risk of passing on the virus - and do not need to isolate for as long as someone who\u2019s unvaccinated, \u201d Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cThat\u2019s because the amount of viral, genetic material declines faster in fully vaccinated people. \u201cVaccination also helps prevent a person with COVID-19 from becoming seriously ill and reduces the likelihood they\u2019ll end up in hospital. It is the greatest protection we have against the virus. \u201dUnder the changes, household contacts of a COVID-19 case will self-isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status, because this group is at highest risk of contracting the virus. \u201cThis change reflects the different transmission dynamic of the Delta variant, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. Close contacts who are fully vaccinated need to self-isolate for 7 days. Close contacts who are partially vaccinated or not vaccinated need to self-isolate for 10 days. To be fully vaccinated, it needs to be 7 days or more since you had your second dose of the vaccine. The other change announced today is the tightening of use of the casual plus contact category, to a narrow range of circumstances. There is very little evidence of transmission in this category, with preliminary data showing only 0.1 percent of casual plus interactions resulted in infections. \u201cKeeping the contact tracing categories as they were would have resulted in some people being identified as contacts when the data now tells us they\u2019re at very, very low risk, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. Information about the changes to the contact tracing categories can be found on the Ministry of Health website.",

The Government has today confirmed for the first time the amount of money it has allocated over two years for vaccines and the vaccination programme. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccination programme is key to securing our economic recovery, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cNew Zealand will continue to face uncertainties over the coming year as COVID-19 spreads and evolves globally, and it\u2019s critical we keep investing in our health response to keep New Zealanders safe. \u201cEffective and ongoing vaccination of the community will also unlock economic opportunities and allow us to safely reopen our borders over time. \u201cOur health response has been strong and successful so far, but we\u2019re taking nothing for granted. Setting aside $1.4 billion for vaccines and infrastructure means New Zealand is well-placed to meet our COVID-19 challenges head on. \u201cOf this, more than $1 billion has been allocated for purchasing vaccines and specialist equipment. $964.3 million is for manufacturer advance purchase agreements and the COVAX facility to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. $66.3 million is for specialist vaccine equipment, including purchase of syringes and related vaccine storage facilities and transport. \u201cWe have secured sufficient doses to vaccinate everyone in New Zealand for free and to also support our Pacific neighbours. Additional vaccines deemed safe and effective can be deferred for later use and further donated to support regional recovery. \u201cThe remaining $356.9 million has been allocated for technology to support the roll-out, funding for DHBs, ongoing support for Medsafe, and to stand up community immunisation centres. \u201cThis is a massive investment to continue support for what is the biggest single undertaking the health system has ever faced. \u201cIn addition to the $1.4 billion, $30 million has gone into vaccine research and the potential for domestic manufacturing and $75 million for Official Development Assistance funding to support Pacific and global vaccine access. \u201cWe\u2019re closely monitoring the programme to ensure it\u2019s as effective and efficient as it can be and so we can prepare to support annual immunisation programmes in future to maintain the ground we have gained, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "Trade and Export Growth Minister Damien O\u2019Connor\u00a0today announced details of his planned visit to the United Kingdom and European Union next week, where he will hold trade and agriculture discussions to further New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s economic recovery from COVID-19. The visit will add political weight to ongoing negotiations with both the EU and the UK on free trade agreements with New\u00a0Zealand. In addition to visiting London and Brussels, Damien O\u2019Connor\u00a0will go to Singapore, en route to Europe, and Paris. The trip marks the first international travel by a New\u00a0Zealand Minister since February 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Damien O\u2019Connor will be accompanied by MFAT Deputy Secretary and Chief Negotiator for the EU-NZ FTA Vangelis Vitalis. New Zealand\u2019s Dublin-based Chief Negotiator for the UK-NZ FTA, Brad Burgess will also join the Minister for the London leg. Mr. Burgess is currently serving as New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s Ambassador to Ireland. \u201cVirtual engagements have served us very well over the last year, but I\u2019m very much looking forward to face to face engagement, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cBeing able to meet with my counterparts \u2013 albeit socially distanced \u2013 will help us move towards concluding high quality, comprehensive and inclusive FTAs. \u201dUnited Kingdom legIn London, Damien O\u2019Connor is scheduled to meet with his trade counterpart, Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss. This follows their agreement last month to accelerate FTA negotiations between the two nations. He is also expected to meet with Minister of State in the Cabinet Office Lord Frost to discuss New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s trade access interests post-Brexit. As Minister of Agriculture, Damien O\u2019Connor will be meeting with George Eustice, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Minister is also expected to have engagements with industry representatives and New\u00a0Zealand stakeholders in the UK, relevant to both his agriculture and trade portfolios. \u201cNew\u00a0Zealand enjoys a uniquely close bond with the UK through our shared history. \u201cThe relationship is underpinned by wide family, cultural, business and sporting linkages. I can\u2019t think of a stronger foundation on which to build a great free trade agreement. \u201cI see a quality FTA with the UK, negotiated in line with Government\u2019s \u2018Trade for All\u2019 agenda, as galvanising these ties through trade and investment. \u201dBrussels legThe priority in Brussels is adding further momentum to the EU-New\u00a0Zealand FTA negotiations. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to sitting down with key figures in the European Commission at this important stage in our FTA talks, notably my Trade Commissioner counterpart, Valdis Dombrovskis, and Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski. \u201dWhile in Brussels, the Minister is also expected to meet with key Parliamentary and industry representatives, as well as the Belgian Deputy Prime\u00a0Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s. \u201cThe EU and New\u00a0Zealand are strong partners and good friends. It is a real anomaly that we don\u2019t already have a free trade agreement with a partner with whom we share so many values and interests. \u201dParis legIn Paris, Damien O\u2019Connor is scheduled to meet with his counterpart Frank Riester, Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness. \u201cThe New\u00a0Zealand \u2013 France relationship has gone from strength to strength under this Government, not least with our successful joint leadership in recent times of the Christchurch Call. \u201cIn Paris, I will be reinforcing the case for the EU-NZ FTA with one of our most important partners in Europe. There is no better partner for France than New\u00a0Zealand with respect to trade and sustainable development and an FTA will be in both our strategic as well as long term, diversified economic interests. \u201dSingapore en routeOn the way to Europe, Damien O\u2019Connor will stop in Singapore for meetings with Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Trade and Industry, as well as Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, in support of New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s export-led recovery from COVID-19. \u201cThe short visit to Singapore provides the opportunity to engage with one of our most trusted, reliable, and long-standing partners in the region. We share many areas of interest, including APEC 2021, which New\u00a0Zealand is currently hosting. \u201dIn all locations, the Minister will comply with host government COVID-19 restrictions and testing requirements. He will also undertake 14 days of MIQ upon return to New\u00a0Zealand in late June. The Minister and his small travelling delegation have been vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to the trip. \u201cCOVID-19 is teaching us all a lesson in the value of relationships and international cooperation. You only have to look at vaccine supply chains to see just how interconnected our collective fortunes are. Trade is a positive and stabilising force for the world, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said.",

This morning I also announcedfurther pandemic support to the Pacific. \u201cPrior to the signing, Prime Minister Brown and I shared warm discussions on a range of issues including climate change cooperation, tourism, COVID-19 response, and economic recovery. We also had the opportunity to visit infrastructure projects supported by Aotearoa New Zealand. \u201cBuilding on the2001 Joint Centenary Declaration, this is a significant milestone in our relationship and provides a roadmap of commitments for the future. Today is about celebrating our shared successes and highlights our joint ambitions for a prosperous and safe Pacific region, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. Waka Houra and Vaka Purua are, respectively, the Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand M\u0101ori and Cook Islands M\u0101ori terms for the traditional double-hulled canoes that used to journey between the two countries. The name symbolises the enduring links that exist between the Cook Islands and Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand, and the intention to continue to work together to navigate future challenges and opportunities.",

More than 70 percent of those, which equates to 6,688 people, have been delivered in the Auckland region. \u201cWe are well on our way to ensuring those who are most at risk of COVID-19, the cleaners, nurses who carry out health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, hotel workers, airline staff, port authorities and vaccinators will be protected from this virus, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cI\u2019m also pleased to confirm that a third shipment of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines arrived safely yesterday afternoon, which adds a further 65,500 doses, bringing the total number of COVID-19 vaccines in New Zealand to 200,000. \u201cFrom here, we plan to ramp up the vaccination programme, as we move to vaccinate border worker\u2019s families and household contacts. We will then move on to front line health and emergency staff \u2013 those people who may be exposed to COVID-19 while doing their jobs. \u201dBorder worker\u2019s families and household contacts will start to be vaccinated in earnest next week, but in some smaller regions, district health boards have already been able to expand their programmes to include these groups. \u201cIn places like Nelson/Marlborough, the smaller workforce has meant both the border workers and their families have been vaccinated at the same time, with the same batch of doses. This is really good news as it means they will also be protected from the virus, and ahead of schedule. \u201cI look forward to this rolling out in our main centres from next week. \u201d",

        "content": "From today, 1.8 million flu vaccines are available to help protect New Zealanders from winter illness, Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall has announced. \u201cVaccination against flu is safe and will be a first line of defence against severe illness this winter, \u201d Dr Verrall said. \u201cWe can all play a part in preventing illness that send people to hospital, so I\u2019m getting my flu shot today, and urge others to do the same. \u201cEvery winter, our hospitals and thewiderhealthcare system see an increase in pressure, particularly aroundadmissions for respiratory infections and other illnesses. \u201cLast year we saw a combination of COVID and the flu adding to the strain on our hospitals. This year we can help avoid that by getting boosted against COVID and getting a flu jab as well. \u201cWe know flu can be a particularly serious disease for people with weakened immunity, and around 500 New Zealanders die from the flu annually. The flu vaccine reduces the likelihood of ending up in hospital if you get sick this winter. \u201cThe flu vaccine is free for people aged 65 years and over, M\u0101ori and Pacific people aged 55 years and over, pregnant people, and people who have long-term conditions like diabetes, asthma, or heart conditions, children aged 6 months to 12 years old, and people with mental health and addiction issues. \u201cFor many of us, our social lives are now back to what they were pre-Covid so it\u2019s really important to get immunised to help slow the peak of flu season and protect ourselves and our communities, \u201d Dr Verrall said. From today, an additional Covid-19 bivalent booster is also available, meaning in many cases people will be able to get their flu and Covid booster shots at the same time. Book your flu and COVID-19 vaccines now atwww. BookMyVaccine.co.nz, call Healthline on 0800 28 29 26, or contact your GP, pharmacy or healthcare provider. \u201cAll New Zealanders over 30 and over can access the booster as long as it\u2019s been at least 6 months since their last COVID-19 booster or positive COVID-19 test, \u201d Dr Verrall said. \u201cPeople at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 will also be able to receive an additional booster, regardless of how many doses they\u2019ve previously had. \u201cWhile we know vaccinations will be hugely important in ensuring people stay well and out of hospital, if people do get sick we also want to make sure they have a range of options to access health advice and care in their community, wherever they are. \u201cYou can get clinical advice from Healthline, your local doctor who may also be able to see you via telehealth, your pharmacy or your local health provider. In key areas of the country Accident and Medical clinics will be open longer, relieving pressure on EDs. \u201cWe can all play a part in staying well this winter, \u201d Dr Verrall said.",

The Government is rolling out additional measures to help tackle the second Omicron wave and record levels of flu to ease pressure on the health system and health workers. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the combination of a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations, the worst flu season in recent memory and corresponding staff absences are putting health workers and the whole health system under extreme pressure, \u201d Minister for COVID-19 Response Dr Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cOur modelling suggests we\u2019re at the beginning of a second Omicron wave that could be bigger than the first, with the more transmissible BA.5 variant becoming the dominant strain in the community. \u201cThere has been a significant increase in cases over the past two weeks, and worryingly the biggest jump is in cases amongst New Zealanders aged 65 and over. That in turn has led to an increase in hospital occupancy. \u201cWe are continuing to ask New Zealanders to do three things - get vaccinated, wear a mask in many or most indoor settings and isolate when sick to suppress the spread of the virus over the remaining winter months. If we all play our part we can take some pressure off the health system. \u201cTo support this we are implementing a range of measures to help Kiwis stay well. These extra measures will help get us and the health system through the winter months. Please do your bit. Medicines\u201cWe are increasing access to antiviral medication to those most likely to end up in hospital, making free masks and RATs more widely available and doing another push to lift uptake of flu and COVID-19 vaccines including the second booster. \"Antiviral medications can reduce the seriousness of COVID-19 meaning fewer people need to be hospitalised, so we are making these more widely available as pharmacist only medications. \u201cPharmac are also broadening the eligibility criteria to enable more people from higher risk groups to access antiviral medications. Pharmac will be making further announcements about this today. \u201cThese eligible groups will be able to access antivirals without the need for a doctor\u2019s prescription. This means access will expand from 2 per cent to 10 per cent of cases. \u201cFrom Monday 18 July anyone over 75 years of age who has tested positive for COVID-19 or anyone who has been admitted previously to an Intensive Care Unit directly as a result of COVID-19, will be eligible to access antivirals through their GP. \u201cThis will help alleviate pressure on primary care by removing the need for GPs to review every COVID-19 patient that may be eligible for antivirals. \u201cTo speed up access to antivirals, GPs can now provide back pocket prescriptionswhichmeans at-risk patients for acute respiratory illnesses can be preapproved and have their prescription ready should they become unwell and need the medicine immediately. RATs and masks\u201cTo increase uptake in use in RATs and masks packs of medical masks will be provided free along with free RAT kits for individuals and households from testing centres and in more locations by the end of the week. You do not need to have COVID-19 symptoms. And P2/N95 masks will be available for clinically vulnerable and high risk individuals. \u201cFree RATs will be available from all current community providers, including marae, testing stations and local pharmacies. \u201cWe are encouraging everyone who needs extra RATs or masks to head to a testing site or other location and collect a free pack for you and your wh\u0101nau. There is no criteria, you don\u2019t need to be unwell or have symptoms. \u201cWearing masks can reduce new cases of the virus by as much as 53 per cent. We are asking New Zealanders to keep up good mask wearing, especially over the remaining winter months where the virus is more likely to pass in indoor settings. \u201cThe tried and tested measures: wearing a high quality mask, strong vaccine and booster uptake, antivirals and testing are highly effective and will put us in the best position to get through what is one of the toughest winters we\u2019ve faced. \u201cWe are also providing 10 million child-size masks available for year 4-7 students in New Zealand and up to 30,000 masks a week for all other students and school staff, alongside extra funding to support better ventilation over winter. \u201cThese are the most effective measures we have. They are simple but if we all do them we can lessen illness and the burden on our health system and dedicated health workers, and get through this darkest part of winter, \u201d Dr Verrall said. Notes to editors:Over the past 2 months:10.4 million RATs have been distributed.16 million medical procedure masks (7.9 million of these have been distributed through community providers)Over 3 million N95s (over 167,000 of these via community groups to high risk or vulnerable people). The Ministry of Health currently have on hand 46.6 million RATs, 41 million medical procedure masks, and 5.1 million N95s for community use, with good supply chains in place to meet increased demand as people protect themselves and others this winter.",

        "content": "COVID-19 continues to be a powerful reminder of the importance of language and culture to the wellbeing of our Pacific communities, said the Minister for Pacific Peoples, Aupito William Sio. \u201cOur Tokelau community in Aotearoa has responded strongly to the challenges of the global pandemic by getting vaccinated and supporting others in our Pacific communities to get their vaccine. \u201cThe people of Tokelau also know only too well how the global currents of uncertainty wrought by climate change erode physical and spiritual wellbeing as they also damage the land and natural environment. \u201cSo, it\u2019s appropriate that for this year\u2019s Tokelau Language Week, the Tokelau community has chosen \u2018Tokelau! Tapui tau gagana ma tau aganuku, i te manaola ma te lautupuola\u2019 which means \u2018Tokelau! Preserve your language and culture, to enhance spiritual and physical wellbeing, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. \u2018Tapui\u2019 emphasises the need to care for and nurture the Tokelau Language and culture to ensure its growth and prosperity. \u201cThey have also embraced, for the second year running, the opportunities presented by celebrating Te Gagana o Tokelau \u2013 the Tokelau language \u2013 online, in order to keep people safe from Covid 19. \u201cThere\u2019s a traditional saying in Tokelau culture, \u201cko na alofivae e h\u0113 m\u0101tutu\u201d, that means in English \u2018the soles of our feet are never dry\u2019 \u2013 our work is never done, we must keep persevering. \u201cI know this spirit of resilience, embodied in the Kanava wood so beloved of Tokelau\u2019s carvers, will ensure that the language and culture of Tokelau are preserved, raising\u00a0 the spiritual and physical wellbeing of our Tokelau people, be they here in Aotearoa or back on the beautiful atolls of Tokelau. \u201dTokelau\u2019s three coral atolls, Atafu, Fakaofo and Nukunonu, cover a total land area of just 12 square kilometres. The most recent census records 8,676 Tokelauans living in Aotearoa, almost half of those in the Whanganui-a-Tara region. This year marks 73 years since Tokelau became part of the New Zealand realm. \u201cTake the time this year to join Tokelauans across the motu in celebrating Tokelau Language Week with a variety of online activities. Even learning a greeting or two can be the window into Tokelau\u2019s cultural traditions, as well as a chance to meet new people, with fresh perspectives, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. Editor\u2019s Note :Tokelau Language Week has been celebrated since 2012 as part of the Ministry for Pacific Peoples\u2019 Pacific Language Weeks programme and is the ninth and final language week to be celebrated this year. The Language Week will run from 4 pm on Sunday 24 October to Saturday\u00a030 October and is being launched online byMafutaga Tokelau I Manawatuvia the official Tokelau Language Week 2021https://www.facebook.com/nztokelaulanguageweek/.

        "content": "Northland will move to Alert Level 3 restrictions from 11:59pm tonight following recent information on the risk presented by the positive case initially tested in Whangarei earlier this week and confirmed in Auckland yesterday, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said. The person is now in an Auckland Managed Isolation Quarantine facility. \u201cUpdated information provided by the police today shows the case moved extensively around Northland after travelling there on 2 October, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWe believe this new information warrants an alert level change decision to keep Northland people safe. \u201cWe recognise that it is unusual to put a region into Alert Level 3 when there are no further cases. However it\u2019s vitally important that we get ahead of any potential spread, and set up widespread testing and continue contact tracing efforts. \u201cRestrictions will remain in place until 11.59pm Tuesday and will be reviewed at Cabinet on Monday. \u201cThis is a strict Level 3 and as with Waikato, the easing steps announced for Auckland earlier this week will not apply to Northland. \u201cThe Auckland boundary will stay in place. \u201cA public health investigation continues to identify close contacts and any potential locations of interest. \u201cThe information we have at this stage is that the person was in Northland from the afternoon of 2 October until the evening of 6 October. They are believe to have travelled around the region, including in Whangarei, Kamo, Paihia and Kawakawa, before returning to Auckland. \u201cWidespread testing and wastewater testing will take place over the weekend. \u201cEvery Northlander needs to stay home, get tested as soon as possible if they have symptoms, and continue to check the Ministry of Health website for updated locations of interest. And of course vaccination centres continue to be open in Alert Level 3. \u201cWe know many people in Northland live rurally, but the advice is the same for everyone \u2013 get vaccinated, get tested, and follow the Alert Level 3 requirements. \u201cAs we have seen in Waikato the virus is finding its way into rural areas and finding unvaccinated people. Distance is no barrier. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never been more urgent to get vaccinated and we urge everyone to act now \u2013 don\u2019t wait. Information on vaccine centres is available on the HealthPoint website. \u201dLocations of interest, testing and vaccinationThe first locations of interest for Northland have been added to the Ministry of Health\u2019s website. They are the BP Connect Wylies petrol station at 49 Maunu Road, Woodhill, Whangarei from 11.20pm on 2 October to 12.20am 3 October. And the Z Kensington service station, corner of Kamo Road and Nixon Street, Whangarei from 3.45pm-4.45pm on 4 October. Testing centres operating in the Northland region are at Kaitaia Hospital; 1 Sammaree Place in Kerikeri, Dargaville Hospital; 20 Winger Crescent in Kamo; and Pohe Island in Whangarei.",

In November, Cabinet agreed on $2 million in funding for the Ministry for Pacific Peoples to support outreach into the Pacific Community. This will underpin their safe transition to the COVID-19 Protection Framework. \u201cThis investment will ensure the shift to the COVID-19 Protection Framework is well communicated and understood by our Pacific communities. \u201cFrom now until June 2022, MPP will engage with our communities throughout Aotearoa supporting an educational empowerment approach to Pacific peoples. I want them to have the confidence and independence to navigate safely their movements under the new framework in the languages the different Pacific nations understand, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. The COVID-19 Protection Framework replaces the elimination strategy and former alert level system. \u201cThis transition to the COVID-19 Protection Framework is supported by our vaccination rates reaching 90 percent to minimise the spread of COVID-19. I am delighted that 92 percent of Pacific people, eligible to receive the vaccine, had received their first dose. \u201cDelivery of the Pacific Aotearoa Community Outreach fund will enable the Ministry to determine where support and assistance is required and guide that response \u2013 such as investing in workshops to keep communities safe; initiatives to encourage Pacific people to get fully vaccinated; and programmes to remove barriers hindering Pacific communities. \u201cThis will include access to digital devices, to enable greater awareness and access to online information. \u201cI expect this to reach over 1,000 Pacific peoples nationally, and create 50 targeted initiatives and pilots, The Pacific Aotearoa Community Outreach fund will ensure our people are supported to transition and live safely in the new framework, \u201d Aupito William Sio said.",

        "content": "Foreign Affairs Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has confirmed Aotearoa New Zealand is providing further economic support to the Pacific to strengthen economic resilience in response to the impact of COVID-19. \u201cThe Pacific region is our home and there are so many links that have shaped Aotearoa New Zealand. Our economic interests are also intertwined and we must continue to create mutual opportunities with our neighbours, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. \u201cThe whole region has felt the economic impact of COVID-19, especially on our tourism and hospitality sectors. Businesses, workers and communities across the Pacific will take some time to recover and rebuild. \u201cAotearoa New Zealand is committed to keep working in partnership with Pacific nations on economic resilience. I am pleased to confirm that up to NZ$75 million in additional economic support is provided in Budget 2022. \u201cThis contingency funding can be drawn-down to continue economic support for Pacific countries should the need arise in 2022/23. \u201cBudget support is in line with Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand\u2019sPacific Resilience Approachand demonstrates our respect for the sovereignty of Pacific countries. It has helped countries maintain core services and step-up their health responses in the face of reduced revenues due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThe extra NZ$75 million contingency support is in addition to approximately NZ$325 million already provided for emergency budget support to countries impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19. \u201cWhile the Pacific is expected to return to growth in 2022, the recovery is likely to be slower than initially forecast. Many Pacific countries remain in the midst of their first COVID-19 outbreaks. A number still have tight border controls and other restrictions still in place. \u201cDue to the scale of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, the implications of ongoing supply chain disruptions, and a degree of uncertainty around international travel, it is likely to take several years before Pacific economies return to pre-pandemic levels. \u201cOur support through the pandemic has also seen us donate and fund with partners more than 1.349 million doses of vaccine to the Pacific. We have also provided PPE equipment and deepened our people partnerships with training and workforce development, in order to support vaccination programmes and laboratory infrastructure. \u201cIn addition to health and vaccine support, New Zealand is also supporting other initiatives that contribute to economic resilience. These include improved access to advice and finance for small-medium businesses in the Cook Islands and supporting Fiji to implement reforms to improve the business and investment climate. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented economic impact on the region and so New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s response has adjusted for these fiscal risks. Even as borders begin to reopen, Pacific countries will require additional financing to move back onto a resilience path. \u201cNew\u00a0Zealand has for many years worked with a number of Pacific countries on economic reform including the provision of budget support. This will continue as the wider region recovers and rebuilds, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta.",

That figure, coupled with 95 percent of New Zealanders being fully vaccinated, means we now have a high level of collective immunity. \u201cNew Zealanders have worked incredibly hard to get through this pandemic and as a result of those efforts we are now in a position to move forward and change the way we do things. \u201cFirst up we have simplified the COVID-19 Protection Framework to target restrictions at those activities that reduce transmission the most. \u201cFrom 4 April, My Vaccine Pass will no longer be required by the Government meaning Kiwis will no longer have to be vaccinated in order to enter those venues covered by the Pass. \u201cWe recognise that some businesses, events or venues may still choose to use vaccine passes, so we will maintain the infrastructure for them. \u201cFrom 4 April, vaccine mandates will be removed, except for health and disability, aged care, corrections and border workforces. \u201cLike many other countries we are retaining a small number of mandates targeted at keeping our COVID-19 frontline staff safe and to ensure our most vulnerable, like those in aged care facilities or those with disabilities, are protected from the virus. \u201cI know for many this part of our defence against COVID-19 was one of the hardest. But mandates meant we reached the levels of vaccination needed to prevent the devastating outbreaks seen across the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve also used the evidence gathered over the last few months on Omicron to make changes to the Red and Orange settings. \u201cFrom midnight this Friday outdoor gathering limits will be lifted. We know being outdoors for gatherings is safe. We want to encourage that, especially at Red. \u201cWe also believe we can lift indoor gathering limits at Red with little material impact on hospitalisations, so these will double from 100 to 200. \u201cOrange settings remain broadly the same with no gathering limits but extra guidance on holding safe events, and a new requirement for workers to wear masks at indoor events. \u201cAnd so, simply put, Red means indoor gathering limits and masks, Orange means masks, and Green means guidance. \u201cAt all levels, the testing and isolation requirements remain as they are now. \u201cWe are keeping the traffic light framework in order to offer ongoing protections in the event of a new variant or in cases of future surges, but our plan is to move down to Orange and then ultimately Green once it is safe to do so. \u201cPutting people\u2019s health first is the best economic approach. The hard work and sacrifices of New Zealanders delivered the lowest numbers of cases and deaths in the OECD for the last two years and puts us in the best position to recover strongly. \u201cWith our cases coming down it\u2019s time to take our next steps with confidence in the collective immunity and protections we have built up. These new settings support greater economic activity and get everyone closer to feeling a bit more normal, while also continuing to manage COVID-19 and provide protection and care for those who need it most. \u201cWith our economy now larger than pre-COVID levels, record low levels of unemployment, and tourism about to reopen we are in a strong position to accelerate our recovery. Our COVID-19 restrictions have been tough, but they have delivered a strong foundation for us to move forward, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.

        "content": "A significant COVID-19 workforce milestone has been reached, with the 5000thvaccinator completing specialised training to administer the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. \u201cA huge amount of work has been going on behind the scenes to boost numbers of trained vaccinators and this is a milestone worth celebrating, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThis specialised online training has been vitally important in ensuring we have sufficient workforce ready as we continue to ramp-up our COVID-19 vaccine rollout. \u201cThe Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) started running the training for the Pfizer vaccine in February and as of this week, we\u2019ve had 5,358 vaccinators who\u2019ve completed the programme. \u201cSo far, almost 2,000 vaccinators have been involved in actively immunising people since the COVID-19 vaccine rollout started nearly three months ago. \u201cOur dedicated vaccinators - nurses, doctors, pharmacists and those in other approved vaccinating professions - are working extremely hard to protect New Zealanders against this virus as our rollout expands into Group 3, and I want to thank them for their vital contribution. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the most significant roll-out won\u2019t begin until July when we start vaccinating the general public so we\u2019re preparing our vaccination workforce with that timeline in mind. \u201cCurrent modelling indicates we\u2019ll need around 1,600 full-time equivalent vaccinators when our vaccination rollout peaks later this year. \u201cNot all of the people trained so far will be available to work full-time, so additional initiatives are also underway to further boost our pool of vaccinators. \u201cLast week for instance, the Ministry of Health kicked off consultation with the health and disability sector about change to the Medicines Regulations to allow a range of people across the country to work as supplementary COVID-19 vaccinators. \u201cAs part of this change, we would target people with health and disability sector experience, such as kai\u0101whina, internationally-trained healthcare professionals who are not currently registered in New Zealand and New Zealand-trained healthcare professionals with lapsed annual practising certificates. This new workforce would undergo specialist training first and their work would be fully supervised. \u201cThis change would also enable us to increase the numbers of M\u0101ori and Pacific in our vaccinator workforce, who are currently under-represented. \u201cWe\u2019re also improving the Ministry of Health COVID-19 Surge Workforce database to better support the next phase of the scale-up. Since the database was launched in early last year, there have been many thousands of people register their interest in supporting the programme across various roles, including as vaccinators. \u201cThis is New Zealand\u2019s largest-ever vaccination rollout and today\u2019s milestone is great news as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver vaccines to New Zealanders. I look forward to seeing our trained workforce continue to expand, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "The Government is providing a funding boost to Pacific health providers to assist them with the delivery of the Government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Pacific communities. \u201cOur Pacific providers know and can reach our communities best. They will have access to vaccines on a rolling basis. This will enable them to vaccinate as many people as they can reach , \u201d Associate Minister of Health Aupito William Sio says. \u201cThese providers are trusted. Theyhave the language skills and cultural intelligence to engage with Pacific communities effectively. They will mobilise vaccination services to make it easy for people to access services, such as holding temporary clinics in our churches, workplaces and where our communities gather. \u201cThe second tranche of vaccinations will focus on non-border frontline workers and those living in high-risk settings. This includes those in the Counties Manukau DHB district over the age of 65 years or who live with relevant underlying health conditions. \u201cThis will also include older members of our Pacific communities who don\u2019t live in residential care facilities. This is important as we know many of our older Pacific peoples live at home supported by their aiga, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. Pacific health providers have the discretion to immunise family members living with older people, disabled people and people with relevant underlying health conditions when they accompany them to the appointment. This will be, however, with consideration to enough vaccine doses being available on site to meet expected demand until new deliveries arrive. There are a range of measures that the Government will implement to ensure equity and support for Pacific Peoples throughout the COVID-19 vaccine programme, including:Investing $10.5 million to support Pacific service delivery options. Investing $4 million to support Pacific providers to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. Investing $750,000 to support additional workforce training and development for Pacific Health providers and vaccinators. Training and support to ensure the cultural competency of the vaccinator workforce. Enabling community-based delivery so that Pacific people can easily access vaccination. Developing accessible information in our nine Pacific languages. Deliver a dedicated social marketing campaign to raise awareness for Pacific communities. \u201cThe COVID-19 Immunisation roll-out has a specific focus on encouraging our Pacific communities to get vaccinated. \u201cThroughout the COVID-19 response, the Government has proactively recognised the need to ensure Pacific communities are vaccinated. \u201cThe Ministry of Health is working in partnership with the Ministry for Pacific Peoples to deliver a targeted Pacific engagement campaign. This includes communications in our nine Pacific languages and across channels like radio, print media, zoom and face-to-face fono, \u201d says Aupito William Sio.",

The Prime Ministers reflected on the close and enduring relationship the two countries have shared in the 60 years since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, and since Samoa gained independence. \u201cAotearoa New Zealand is committed to enhancing and continuing to strengthen our relationship with Samoa as lifelong friends \u2014 or u\u014d mamae \u2014 and I am proud to announce a special Prime Minister\u2019s Fellowship in Prime Minister Mata\u2019afa\u2019s name to celebrate the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. The Prime Ministers issued a Joint Statement acknowledging the strong cooperation on COVID-19 and vaccines, a commitment to work together to navigate post-pandemic economic challenges, the importance of regional unity, and the pre-eminent role of existing regional architecture, such as the Pacific Island Forum. They also agreed to strengthen cooperation on climate change, including Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s commitment to provide funding support to Samoa\u2019s climate change priorities and the implementation of its climate change adaptation plans. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed their support for the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now. \u201cClimate change has been identified as the top priority for the region. This is reflected in New Zealand\u2019s fourfold increase in climate aid to $1.3 billion, with at least fifty percent going to the Pacific, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cSome of this funding will go to supporting Samoa to deliver on its climate change priorities by providing climate finance towards Samoa\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution, National Adaptation Plan of Action, and other government efforts to address climate change, including adaptation and mitigation efforts. \u201cWe are committed to working closely together on the complex challenges facing our countries and communities, our Blue Pacific Continent, and indeed, the rest of the world, in a manner that demonstrates the manaakitanga and respect we have for each other, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

        "content": "Ministers have connected from across the globe to discuss trade, economic recovery and technical cooperation during the final APEC Ministerial meeting\u00a0of New Zealand\u2019s host year. Co-chaired by Foreign Affairs Minister, Nanaia Mahuta, and Trade and Export Growth Minister, Damien O\u2019Connor, discussions were focused on resilient recovery from COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific region. \u201cAPEC Ministers have recognised the need for a COVID recovery that ensures no one is left behind. This particularly includes women and indigenous peoples who are most negatively impacted by the global pandemic, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cIt is also important that APEC continues to emphasise its strong support for global climate commitments and a low-emission, climate-resilient future for the region. \u201cI was pleased that we could agree to a plan to halt the increase of harmful fossil fuel subsidies \u2013 which drive environmental degradation and contribute to climate change, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta\u00a0said. Minister Damien O\u2019Connor also said that real progress had been made under New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s leadership of APEC\u201cSince trade Ministers discussed vaccine supply chains in June, most APEC economies have made access to vaccines easier by lowering tariffs, rejecting export restrictions, and getting vaccines through ports faster. \u201cMinisters agreed it is essential APEC supports the WTO in achieving an ambitious set of outcomes as we re-stabilise it in December. This approach will benefit all. Free, fair and open trade will get us all through the pandemic, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor\u00a0said. In hosting APEC, New Zealand\u2019s priorities have been:Agreement on economic and trade policies to strengthen the COVID-19 recovery;Increasing inclusion and sustainability for a more resilient recovery, andPursuing innovation and a digitally enabled recovery. The APEC Ministerial Meeting is one of the major events in the series of events held during 8-13 November hosted by New Zealand.",

It shows our plan for what is the biggest and most complex logistical undertaking ever by the health system is on track. \u201cThe doses will arrive in weekly drops, ramping up in quantity from mid July as we start to move to the wider population roll out. \u201cThe drops will enable us to continue vaccinating Groups 1,2, and 3, while giving us the certainty needed to start the general population rollout as planned. \u201cThe supplies means DHBs can keep delivering to their plans and start accelerating their way through Group 3 from mid July \u2013 which is everyone over the age of 65 and people with disabilities and some underlying health conditions. It\u2019s a group of more than 1 million people and will take time to work through. As we start Group 4, we will significantly ramp up our vaccination efforts. \u201dChris Hipkins said around 20,000 doses a day were currently being administered and the Pfizer deliveries throughout July will enable this to increase significantly. At the peak of the programme in August and September we expect to be administering 50,000 doses per day. \u201cThis will add to the significant momentum already being generated by New Zealand\u2019s vaccine programme. \u201dPlan on track\u201cTo date, we\u2019ve fully vaccinated over a quarter of a million people. That is a pleasing milestone. Our strategy has meant we\u2019ve largely avoided having to stretch the time between first and second doses as many countries have, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWork is well advanced to set up more vaccination sites, deliver mass vaccination events, and bring more GPs and pharmacies on-board to help with the rollout. \u201cWhile we know the ongoing pandemic can impact vaccine delivery schedules, Pfizer has given us further assurances that the remaining deliveries for 2021 are also on track, just as their deliveries to date have been. \u201cWe have vaccinated more people than we had planned for at this point in time and more than 6,800 vaccinators have completed the necessary training to administer the Pfizer vaccine. \u201cWe have at our disposal one of the best vaccines in the world and starting later next month we will start making it available, for free, to everyone in New Zealand over the age of 16. \u201d",

However high case numbers and household contacts, and the current 10 day isolation requirement, is having a wider impact on many parts of our lives, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThere needs to be a balance between effectively controlling the outbreak and the flow-on effect for business and essential goods and services such as transport and food supply. \u201cThe most up to date public health advice is that there is a decline in infectiousness of Omicron over time, and that in most cases transmission occurs within seven days. \u201cOur primary objective is to stop the chain of transmission as much as possible to manage the spread of Omicron. Seven days isolation will break the vast majority of potential transmissions, while ensuring people can get back to work quicker and therefore reducing the impact on business operations. \u201dThe change will come into effect from 11:59pm Friday 11 March. Household contacts will need to have a rapid antigen test at day 3 and day 7 of their isolation period. If they become symptomatic they should also get a test, and if the result is positive, they are required to isolate for seven days from that point. If a person is isolating and still has symptoms after seven days, they are advised to stay home until 24 hours after symptoms resolve. \u201cI urge everyone to make sure they report their rapid antigen test result on My Covid Record, even if it is negative, so we can understand transmission within households and how the outbreak is spreading through communities, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe reduction in the isolation period follows similar changes overseas and increasing evidence that people are most likely to transmit the virus earlier in their infectious period. This evidence also shows that the risk of reinfection within the first three months after someone has Omicron is very low. \u201cFor this reason, recovered cases will no longer need to self-isolate if they become a household contact within 90 days after having the virus. This is an increase from the current 28 days. \u201cUnder the Red setting of the COVID-19 Protection Framework there are additional public health measures in place that reduce the risk of onwards infection. These include limits on the sizes of gatherings, wearing face masks and physically distancing. I urge people to follow these guidelines to continue to protect our vulnerable friends and wh\u0101nau, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Novavax available to book from tomorrow\u201cNew Zealanders awaiting the arrival of Novavax to get vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to make an appointment online or by phone from tomorrow, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cA shipment of more than 250,000 Novavax COVID-19 vaccines (Nuvaxovid) has arrived in New Zealand and preparations are well advanced for some vaccination centres to be able to offer it next week. \u201cNovavax will be available for people aged over 18. It requires two doses, with a three week gap. It has not been approved as a booster dose. \u201cWhile the Pfizer vaccine remains the preferred COVID-19 vaccine in New Zealand, Novavax is now available for those people who would prefer, or require, an alternative, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. People are able to book a Novavax vaccine throughBookMyVaccine.nz or by calling Healthlinefrom Thursday 10 March, with the first vaccine appointments available at a limited number of sites from Monday 14 March.

The extended COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2021 comes into effect at 11.59pm on 25 October, requiring workers who face a high risk of exposure to COVID-19 and who work in the health and disability and education sectors or in prisons to be fully vaccinated. \u201cThis is a significant development as our vaccination programme continues to roll out, \u201d says Chris Hipkins. \u201cIt\u2019s a comprehensive Order, and will require all health and disability workers and education workers to have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by 15 November 2021. \u201cGeneral practitioners, pharmacists, community health nurses, midwives, paramedics, and healthcare and disability workers in facilities where vulnerable patients are treated (including ICU), are amongst those included. \u201cIt also covers many workers doing non-regulated healthcare work, for example providers in aged residential care and workers who enter homes to provide community support services. \u201cIn finalising the Order, it\u2019s been decided that it will now apply to healthcare and disability workers from 15 November, as the date when they\u2019ll be required to have had their first dose. \u201cThis aligns with the education sector and is a change from the 30 October date initially indicated, following feedback from the health and disability sector. \u201cWe recognise the sector as being supportive of the mandate but we\u2019ve listened to their views on the proposed timeline, including the potential impact on staff rosters and a desire to support all staff to meet the timeframe. \u201cThe end result will be that both the health and disability workers and the education sector workers must be fully vaccinated by 1 January 2022. \u201dFor those working in the education sector, the amendment applies to early childhood services as well as registered schools, including State schools, State integrated school and all private schools. \u201cWork is continuing on whether mandatory vaccinations will be required in the tertiary education sector. \u201cPrison facilities are also included and the first deadline for those workers is 6 November. In that context, the order applies to prison staff, health care staff working in prisons, psychologists (working in prisons), and many of the people contracted to provide services to prisons. \u201cWe recognise that the health and disability, education and prison workforces have responded to the pandemic with dedication and an incredible amount of hard work and we thank them for that. \u201cBecause of the nature of their work, these groups are all at particular risk of being infected with COVID-19, and of passing it on to the vulnerable groups they work with, as well as wh\u0101nau, and members of the wider community. \u201cWhile most people in these sectors have already taken the necessary steps to protect themselves and those around them, having complete protection is critical to the country\u2019s successful management of the pandemic. \u201dNotes to editors:Workers who only sometimes work in school, prison or health and disability environments may also be subject to the Order, and should consult the Ministry of Health\u2019s website. Workers who have proof of having been vaccinated overseas with one of Medsafe\u2019s four approved vaccines will qualify as having met the terms of the Order. Border workers have been required by the Order to be vaccinated since 30 September. Dates by which workers in the different sectors will be required to be vaccinated by:Health and Education:First dose \u2013 23.59 hrs 15 November 2021Second dose - 23.59 hrs 1 January 2022. Prisons:First dose \u2013 23.59 hrs 6 November 2021Second dose \u2013 23.59 hrs 8 December 2021",

Previously, the Scheme only covered events in this period if they were already planned before New Zealand moved to Red in January 2022. \u201cThis change aims to further support our artists, musicians, performers and Kiwis who make a living out of arts and culture. It also recognises that a critical part of securing our recovery will be the return of arts and cultural events for all New Zealanders to enjoy. \u201cThe Government remains absolutely committed to ensuring the arts and culture sector survives, adapts and thrives. That\u2019s why the Government\u2019s $374 million COVID-19 Arts and Culture Recovery Programme announced in May 2020 was boosted by an additional $121 million package in February 2022, \u201dThe move to extend coverage of the Arts and Culture Event Support Scheme to new events from 15 June comes alongside other changes for the Scheme designed to relieve pressure on the events sector as the country moves past this Omicron peak. Those changes include support for outdoor events that can now go ahead at Red under the COVID-19 Protection Framework but that may incur financial losses due to reduced audiences and support for financial losses for events that take place during the first six weeks of a change to Orange. The requirement for use of My Vaccine Pass at events has also been removed, to match the updated Covid Protection Framework settings. \u201cThe additional changes to the Arts and Culture Events Scheme extend support to event organisers as we transition to the new provisions of the COVID-19 Protection Framework, and provide Kiwis with opportunities to go out as their confidence increases. We\u2019re working hard to deliver more certainty in an uncertain world. \u201cThe changes to the Framework represent a milestone for Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s response to the pandemic. As our country lifts its sights toward recovery, our communities can begin to enjoy events and express our diverse cultures, \u201d said Carmel Sepuloni.

        "content": "The Government has invested $7.7 million in a research innovation hub which was officially opened today by Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Dr Ayesha Verrall. The new facility named Te P\u0101 Harakeke Flexible Labs comprises 560 square metres of new laboratory space for research staff and is based at Callaghan Innovation\u2019s Gracefield Innovation Quarter site in Lower Hutt. \u201cToday\u2019s opening of newly built cutting-edge lab facilities provides space to undertake more impactful research using new technologies. And could be used for things such as developing new vaccines for fighting COVID-19, \u201d Research, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cConstructing new research facilities is part of a broader plan to improve the opportunities for researchers and industry alike to freely collaborate and make the most of skills and technologies we have available across Aotearoa New Zealand. \u201cInnovation hubs are important catalysts of innovation where research groups are co-located to promote collaboration. \u201cWe want to see a more connected, resilient and adaptable research, science and innovation sector and this is a key aim of our system-wide review of the sector through the Te Ara Paerangi \u2013 Future Pathways programme. \u201cThese new state-of-the-art facilities are a prime example of the positive changes are already underway in the sector. This modular, flexible \u201cturn-key\u201d type of lab can enable scientists, researchers, innovators to carry out their work without having to build their own capital-intensive facilities. \u201cTe P\u0101 Harakeke will be occupied by Callaghan Innovation\u2019s partner the Ferrier Research Institute. The Institute is a team of carbohydrate, analytical and bio-chemistry experts and will work on site with lipid nanoparticles to build research and manufacturing capability for mRNA vaccines and related technologies. \u201cThis will help strengthen our vaccine research capability, including resilience against infectious diseases. Earlier this year, the Government announced a $40.7 million\u00a0investment to create a platform to grow our domestic RNA research base and connect this with industry to facilitate the production of new vaccines, treatments and diagnostics that can support wellbeing and better health outcomes for New Zealanders. As well as responding to COVID-19 this has the exciting potential to begin to address the treatment of cancers as well as neuro-degenerative diseases. \u201cThe Government is also boosting our pandemic resilience and preparedness for future pandemics in other areas such as through our $36 million investment in an Infectious Diseases Research Platform. The Ferrier Research Institute is contributing to this work\u201d\u201cIt was also great to see the development of the new facility supporting the local economy. Callaghan Innovation worked closely with Lower Hutt-based firm Niche Modular to build the innovative and unique laboratories in a nearby factory, before they were relocated to their current site, \u201d Dr Verrall said.",

        "content": "The Government has announced further pandemic support for Pacific Island countries with vaccine boosters, COVID-19 anti-viral treatments, and by strengthening the capacity of the health workforce to respond to further pandemics. \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world, including the Pacific. As we continue our re-connections this year we have a clear focus on supporting the social and economic resilience of our Pacific partners and their health priorities, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cAotearoa New\u00a0Zealand stands alongside the Pacific to further support preparedness and response efforts. It reflects the importance we place on being there for our Pacific fanauthroughout this pandemic, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. Nanaia Mahuta made the announcement in the Cook Islands, during a visit to Rarotonga Hospital where she met frontline health workers involved in the COVID-19 response. The package of support includes:Additional funding of $3.8 million for thePolynesian Health Corridors programmefor pandemic preparedness and response over the next year, to continue COVID-19 immunisation support, provide public health advice and help strengthen the health workforce. A $1.1 million contribution to the World Health Organisation to increase access to COVID-19 therapeutics in the wider Pacific, with accompanying technical support;Access to COVID-19 oral antivirals from Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s domestic supply for the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. There will be accompanying guidance and support, facilitated by the Polynesian Health Corridors team, through clinical specialists and organisations in Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand;Provision of second COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine boosters to the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau as requested. \u201cThe Polynesian Health Corridors programme sees workers from Aotearoa New Zealand step up with public health advice, vaccine rollout support, and health workforce capability building in the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. \u201cThe PHC programme facilitated New Zealand\u2019s donation of almost 44,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Cook Islands. There was also support from clinicians who travelled to the islands to backfill the roles of local health workers during the vaccination rollout. \u201cOur support will ensure Pacific countries have more tools to respond to COVID-19 to keep their populations safe. \u201cOral antiviral treatments and second boosters are an important addition to pandemic response efforts globally. They reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation following COVID-19 infection, especially for people with pre-existing health conditions, \u201d Aupito William Siosaid. \u201cProviding treatments and vaccines through our domestic supply, and increasing access to antiviral treatments in collaboration with the World Health Organization, will enhance countries\u2019 ability to respond to the pandemic and save lives, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cHealth systems across the world have felt the burden of COVID-19. It is our responsibility as a Pacific nation to work together with our Pacific partners to strengthen our collective capabilities to prepare for and respond to pandemics. In the long run, this helps us all in our efforts to achieve a safer, prosperous and resilient Pacific, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said.",

Constitution Day is an opportunity to reflect not only on our common history, but our shared partnership and deep whakapapa connections. Our family ties are real\u201d. In Niue, Minister Sio will meet with Premier Dalton Tagelagi and Niue\u2019s Minister of Social Services Sauni Tongatule, and the wider Cabinet. He will also meet with officials at the forefront of Niue\u2019s COVID-19 response, and progress cooperation in revitalising the Vagahau Niue language. \u201cNiue\u2019s management of the pandemic over more than two years and since borders opened has been extraordinary. Aotearoa has supported Niue closely during the pandemic, and my visit will enable me to pass on our Government\u2019s appreciation to all those who have worked tirelessly to keep Niue safe. Niue has high vaccination rates, aided by the provision of vaccines through the Polynesian Health Corridors programme, and this has assisted the health team and community. That Niue has only ever recorded around 80 cases of the virus, and has just two cases currently is a credit to its border and health management, village community leaders and health sector workers. In line with the Niue-New\u00a0Zealand Statement of Partnership Minister Sio will also meet with language and cultural leaders to discuss the preservation and revitalisation of Taoga Niue and Vagahau Niue. \u201cInvesting in the preservation and resilience of Taoga Niue and Vagahau Niue is a priority for the New\u00a0Zealand Government and the Niuean community who have long advocated for, and supported the recently launched Pacific Languages Strategy. Our commitment reflects our support for intergenerational and cultural resilience in the Pacific and the importance of language to all our well-being. \u201cMy discussions in Niue will enable us to better reflect on how we can better support generations of Niueans, both in Niue and Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand to strengthen pathways and resources for learning Vagahau Niue, \u201d said Aupito William Sio.",

        "content": "Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall has announced today the Government is supporting the development of a vaccine to help prevent rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. \u201cRheumatic fever can have a devastating impact, especially for M\u0101ori and Pacific children and young people, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cAs an infectious diseases doctor, I cared for rangatahi who experienced some of the worst outcomes from this illness. Several had heart valve replacements that became infected, and some suffered strokes. I remember one young woman who needed a heart transplant, and later tragically died. \u201dThe University of Auckland will lead research next year into the vaccine development, which will complement existing work underway in Australia. \u201cBecause New Zealand and Australia are among the few developed countries to still have rheumatic fever, it makes sense for us to collaborate to develop a vaccine. This $10 million investment will help ensure the vaccine is appropriate for the strains of Strep A circulating in Aotearoa New Zealand, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. Funding will also support activities such as enhanced surveillance of Group A streptococcus, more infrastructure for laboratory testing, and preparations to ensure Aotearoa New Zealand is ready to conduct clinical trials. In 2020/21, 107 people were hospitalised for the first time with rheumatic fever in New Zealand. Other Government action to reduce rheumatic fever includes the expansion of the Healthy Homes Initiative to prevent childhood hospitalisations - by increasing the number of children living in warm, dry homes. Rheumatic fever starts from a strep throat infection, andcauses the heart, joints, brain and skin to become inflamed and swollen. People who\u2019ve caught rheumatic fever need to have monthly antibiotic injections for at least 10 years, to prevent it returning - and developing into rheumatic heart disease. M\u0101ori and Pacific tamariki and rangatahi between the ages of four and 19 years old have the highest rates of rheumatic fever. Among Pacific peoples, rheumatic fever occurs mainly in Samoan and Tongan children and young people. The Prime Minister\u2019s Chief Science Advisor has published a report today on rheumatic fever. This Evidence Summary found preventing strep throat infection through vaccination could make a significant difference to the rates of infection and subsequent complications of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.

        "content": "The resilient economy and the Government\u2019s responsible financial management means New Zealand is well positioned to respond to a difficult and challenging global environment. For the three months to the end of September, the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) recorded a deficit of $2.6 billion, a little higher than forecast at Budget 2022 in May. Tax revenue was slightly below expectations, while expenses were slightly above forecast. \u201cThe latest figures are broadly in line with forecasts. They show the resilience of the economy despite the global challenges New Zealand finds itself facing. More people are in paid work which helps to ease cost of living pressures, while the Government is there with them and supporting them with the recently announced childcare package along with the extended fuel tax cuts and half price public transport fares, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cWe are however not immune to what happens overseas which will put pressure on the Government\u2019s books. We will continue to responsibly manage our finances and that means tough choices will be required as we tread a pathway back to surplus. Core Crown tax revenue was $133 million below forecast at $26.7 billion, due to lower-than-expected GST returns and lower Fuel Excise Duties and Road Users Charges, which were cut to support New Zealanders with cost of living pressures. That has more than offset the increase in people being in work. Core Crown expenses were $243 million above forecast at $31.2 billion, due to higher interest costs and health expenses, including for charges for vaccines that occurred during this period. Net debt stood at 19.8 percent of GDP, which was above forecast due to the impact of market conditions affecting the financial portfolio held by the New Zealand Super Fund and ACC derivatives. Using the old measure, Net core Crown debt is below forecast at 38.4 percent of GDP compared with projections of 39.8 percent of GDP. \u201cOur debt levels are among the lowest in the OECD and well below the Government\u2019s debt ceiling of 30 percent, ensuring we are well positioned to weather further economic shocks, \u201d Grant Robertson said\u201cOur successful economic plan and responsible fiscal management means New Zealand is in a strong starting position that allows us to focus on what matters to Kiwis \u2013 growing wages and cost of living pressures, investing in hospitals, schools, and housing and addressing climate change. \u201cOur economy is open and larger than before Covid, we produce what the world wants and our immigration reset is making a difference in attracting overseas workers to address workforce pressures. The summer is full of promise with the return of increasing numbers of tourists. However, the global environment is challenging and we will have to be careful and balanced in our response. \u201cWe continue to prioritise our spending and target support to where it is needed most while keeping debt in check and making important investments in New Zealanders security and wellbeing.

We have the option to purchase up to 3 million additional doses, which would be delivered throughout 2022. \u201cA key point of difference for the Janssen vaccine is that it\u2019s likely to be a single-dose vaccine and is compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels, so it may potentially be more efficient to administer. \u201dMegan Woods said Janssen, along with its parent company Johnson & Johnson, have a very strong track record producing safe and effective pharmaceutical products for use globally and in New Zealand. \u201cThis gives us confidence in their ability to develop, manufacture and deliver a safe and effective vaccine, \u201d Megan Woods saidThis announcement follows the Government\u2019s recent agreement to purchase 1.5 million doses of vaccine \u2013 enough for 750,000 people \u2013 from Pfizer and BioNTech, and works alongside other aspects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy, including membership of the global COVAX Facility. Megan Woods said negotiations with other pharmaceutical companies are progressing well. \u201cThe COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Taskforce are working to ensure that additional agreements are in place to complete the vaccine portfolio. Our main priority is to make sure New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours have access to safe and effective vaccines. The Ministry of Health is preparing for a range of vaccine scenarios and how best to sequence the delivery of vaccines once supply becomes available. Three broad considerations are being explored:Those at risk of contracting COVID-19Those at risk of spreading COVID-19Those at risk of increased morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Ensuring equity of outcomes, including protection for M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and our most vulnerable population groups, such as older people, disabled people, health workers, essential workers and border staff are some of our primary considerations in the availability of vaccines.",

        "content": "New Zealand\u2019s leadership has contributed to a number of significant outcomes and progress at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which concluded in the early hours of Friday morning after a week of intense negotiations between its 164 members. A major outcome is a new Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies following negotiations this week facilitated by Minister for Trade and Export Growth Damien O\u2019Connor. \u201cNew Zealand has been at the forefront of calling for an agreement on fisheries subsidies for over twenty years, so this is a significant milestone, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI was very proud to assist the WTO Director-General as Facilitator for the fisheries negotiation. What we agreed this week will have a meaningful impact on the sustainability of our fisheries resources and the livelihoods of the world\u2019s fishers. \u201dThe agreement includes important prohibitions on subsidies related to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; subsidies regarding over-fished stocks; and subsidies provided to fishing taking place on the unregulated high seas. \u201cWhile negotiators were unable to find agreement on all disciplines, WTO Members have agreed to continue negotiations on these outstanding and very important issues ahead of the WTO\u2019s 13th Ministerial Conference, which is expected to be held in 2023, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThis has been a hugely significant meeting, and has happened at a very difficult time. \u00a0 Just as the world is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, we face growing geo-political tensions including Russia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine. \u201cAt times like these, multilateral organisations like the WTO are more important than ever for small, globally connected countries like New Zealand. \"Another significant outcome from MC12 is that the Members have agreed a package of responses to future emergencies including pandemics, to build on the lessons from our respective experiences in responding to COVID-19. \u00a0 This includes the \u201cTRIPS waiver\u201d on COVID-19 vaccines, which is designed to facilitate the production and distribution of vaccines in developing countries. \u201cNew Zealand was an early supporter of the TRIPS waiver, as we strongly support developing countries being able to better access vaccine IP and increase the supply of vaccines\u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. Ministers also agreed a Declaration on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics, covering issues like transparency and the value of timely and accurate information. \u201cI am also pleased to say that WTO Members have renewed the E-commerce Moratorium until the next Ministerial Conference. This continues the long standing practice of not applying tariffs or duties to electronic transmissions. We know that this is a key enabler for predictable global digital trade for businesses, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a gruelling week, and we didn\u2019t get everything we wanted. There is still an urgent need for further substantial, meaningful progress on agricultural trade reform, including on domestic subsidies, to help feed the world\u2019s population at a time of increased food insecurity. \u201cThere is also still considerable work to do to improve the functioning of the WTO to be able to respond more rapidly to the kinds of crises we have seen in the past two years. These are things that we will continue to work on ahead of the 13th Ministerial Conference, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. Ministerial conferences are the highest decision making body of the WTO. They are traditionally scheduled to occur every two years, but due to COVID-19, the MC12 was the first one to occur in five years. Damien O\u2019Connor returns to New Zealand today from Europe.",

The Bill will be considered by the House again in that week. \u201cThe guidance on a second booster follows advice from the Ministry of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group (CV TAG) on waning of immunity after a COVID-19 booster dose, and the groups in which this may occur more rapidly. \u201cThe majority of people in these groups will become eligible from July, following advice that six months is an appropriate gap between doses. \u201cWhen the Bill passes, the Director General of Health will be able to formally confirm eligibility criteria and details of the rollout of the second booster. \u201dAssociate COVID-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall said a booster is particularly important for those most at risk as we move into winter. \u201cThese changes enable second booster doses to be widely available at vaccination sites and able to be administered by all vaccinators. There is sufficient Pfizer vaccine in stock with current supply sitting at around two million doses. \u201cThe proposed eligible groups are: people aged 65 years and over, M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and over, residents of aged care and disability care facilities and severely immunocompromised people who have received a three-dose primary course and a first booster. \u201cThe proposal to reduce the age of eligibility for older M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples recognises that they have been disproportionately affected in the current Omicron outbreak and are at greater risk of hospitalisation and severe disease from COVID-19. \u201dDr Verrall strongly encouraged first and second booster uptake as an important step to protect people\u2018s health and reduce the pressure on the health system as winter and winter illnesses set in. \u201cGetting a booster reduces the likelihood of a more serious infection and helps keep people out of hospital. \u201cA two-dose primary course and a booster dose provides very good and lasting protection for most people, which means we can be more targeted in the rollout of the second booster. So, for those who haven\u2019t had a first booster, please act now. \u201d",

        "title": "New vaccination requirement for non_citizen travellers to New Zealand",
        "content": "Full vaccination will become a requirement for non-New Zealand citizens arriving into the country from 1 November, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. \u201cGetting vaccinated is the most effective measure against the transmission of COVID-19, and the risk of serious illness or death, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cTo further reduce the possibility of the virus getting through our border, we are introducing the requirement for air travellers aged 17 and over, who are not New Zealand citizens, to be fully vaccinated to enter New Zealand. \u201cThis is an important step in our Reconnecting New Zealand strategy. \u201dTravellers will be required to declare their vaccination status when registering with the Managed Isolation Allocation System, as well as presenting proof of vaccination or a relevant exemption to their airline and to Customs officers once they land. The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group has recommended that a full course of any of the 22 COVID-19 vaccines approved by a government or approval authority, with the last dose being at least 14 days before arrival, will be acceptable at this stage. Guidance will be prepared on what will qualify as evidence of a vaccination or an exemption. \u201cMost people coming to New Zealand tell us they are already vaccinated. This requirement makes it formal and will provide an extra layer of protection at the border. It will work well alongside the announcement today that everyone on board an Air New Zealand aircraft travelling internationally will need to be fully vaccinated from February 2022. \u201dEverybody arriving will still be required to complete 14 days in Managed Isolation and Quarantine, and all travellers except those from exempt locations will still need to have evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result from an accredited laboratory within 72 hours of their first scheduled international flight. \u201cEven a single case presents a risk. However, high and wide-spread vaccination rates will mean more freedoms, fewer restrictions, and the day-to-day confidence that protection from the virus brings. \u201cThis requirement will be an interim measure while development continues on the traveller health declaration system, which will introduce the ability to digitally verify the vaccination status of people arriving into New Zealand. The requirement will be brought in with an amendment to the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020 (Air Border Order). Those subject to the requirement who fail to present proof of vaccination may be subject to an infringement notice under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Act 2020, which under a Bill currently before the House would see infringements carrying a maximum fine of $4000. The requirement will not apply to New Zealand citizens, children under the age of 17, and those who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons. RSE workers coming to NZ as part of the one-way QFT arrangement with Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu will also be exempt due to existing vaccination requirements, as will refugees. There will also be a process to seek exemptions from the Director General of Health on humanitarian grounds, or where people travelling with New Zealand citizens have not had the opportunity to be vaccinated within the timeframes.",

Eleven research projects, funded and delivered under the alliance of 64 countries, have been recently completed. Damien O\u2019Connor said reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions is a global challenge and a key part of the\u00a0Government\u2019sFit for a Better World \u2013 Accelerating our Economic Potential Roadmap, released last year. \u201cThe completed projects have enabled important discoveries, significantly advanced scientists\u2019 understanding, and led to the development of technologies to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. Project milestones include:new technologies for developing methane vaccines which have now been included in New Zealand\u2019s domestic vaccine programme for cattlebetter understanding how \u2018direct-fed\u2019 microbial and silage inoculant products can be produced to enable cows to deliver beneficial microbes to pastures, which includes contributing to Fonterra\u2019s new methane-reducing probiotic for cows calledKowbuchaTMpotential nitrification inhibitors to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from grazed pasturesidentifying new potential compounds and ways to inhibit the production of methane in the rumen of cattleboosting scientific understanding of how irrigation management can reduce nitrous oxide emissions from soils without affecting pasture dry matter productionNew Zealand contributed one third of the global investment of $28.7 million in the projects. Damien O\u2019Connor said the GRA provides a multinational platform to identify global climate issues and work together to make breakthroughs and develop practical solutions. \u201cThe GRA enables us to identify, understand, and tackle issues more rapidly than if each country acted alone. \u00a0 It also provides a network for sharing, so the research outcomes can have wider benefits across the globe. \u201d\u201cFit for a Better Worldhas bold targets for New Zealand to move to a low emissions economy. \u00a0 The important discoveries and technologies from this GRA-funded research add to the growing global toolkit of practical tools and techniques available to our farmers and growers. \u201cNew Zealand has been a leader in pastoral farm production, now we need to be leaders at reducing while producing, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said.",

This will come into place from 2 July 2022.100 per cent of corrections staff in prisons, and as of 23 June 2022 97 per cent of active border workers were fully vaccinated. \u201cAs we have previously said we keep vaccine mandates under continuous review and remove them when safe to do so, \u201d COVID-19 Response MinisterDr Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cVaccination has been one of our strongest and most effective defences to protect against COVID-19. It\u2019s helped protect our border and corrections workers and their wh\u0101nau. But we feel the requirement has served its purpose well. \u201cThe risk COVID-19 poses at the border is much lower than it was previously. Alongside high rates of vaccination amongst border workers the number of passengers arriving by air with COVID-19 is less than 3%. \u201cCorrections staff will also no longer be included in the Vaccination Order. Currently all corrections staff in prisons are fully vaccinated and 72% of people in prison have been fully vaccinated. \u201cHow we manage COVID-19 in Aotearoa continues to change and as certain protections are no longer required we have shown we will remove them. \u201cWe have high levels of vaccination amongst the general population and we have increasing protection in the population from prior infection, so tools like vaccine mandates in most settings are no longer necessary. \u201cOur corrections and border workers have played an extremely important role throughout the pandemic. I can\u2019t thank them enough for their dedication and commitment to keeping us all safe, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said. The Vaccination Order remains in place for health and disability workers as they continue to have close interactions withpeople who are at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19. The settings for health and disability workers are reviewed regularly.",

        "content": "Government investment in regional economic development projects has passed a $2 billion milestone as support for jobs, businesses and infrastructure steps up a gear. Economic and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash says funds administered by the Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit at MBIE (K\u0101noa-RDU) have now paid more than $2.1 billion to projects since 2018. \u201cFrom the Provincial Growth Fund to the Infrastructure Reference Group\u2019s shovel-ready projects, as well as other funds, we are backing communities all over the country and giving them confidence to keep investing, \u201d Stuart Nash said. \u201cIt has been a priority to invest in regional infrastructure which had been previously run down. These investments are even more important as we respond to the economic shock caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cSome modest investments have proved to be the most valuable. Organisations at the heart of communities, like marae and Pasifika churches, have become central in our COVID-19 vaccination and testing efforts. \u201cAs part of the PGF reset in 2020 we invested in smaller community initiatives to deal with the impact of COVID-19 on jobs and businesses. \u00a0 This year many investments have come full circle. Dozens of newly-renovated marae and Pasifika churches have become COVID-19 vaccine and testing centres. \u201cFor example last year Wharekawa Marae in north Waikato received $252,000 for renovation work on its buildings and grounds. This September, it was the site of a pop-up testing facility that swabbed more than half its community after a local positive case. \u201cTe Puna Ora o Mataatua\u2019s M\u0101ori health academy in Whakat\u0101ne received a $2.95 million grant from Te Ara Mahi fund, so 300 young people could receive training and work placements. Graduates are now helping deliver vaccines and tests in the Bay of Plenty. \u201cOne of the earliest PGF grants, to FI Innovations in Southland, was $370,000 to help buy equipment for large-scale 3D printing. It can manufacture medical parts such as ventilator valves, should DHBs need them during the pandemic. \u201cOther investments are significant for enabling development of infrastructure to secure regional jobs, businesses and economies in the face of global uncertainty. \u201cIn the north, the rail network between Swanson and Whangarei had been in managed decline. K\u0101noa-RDU investment of $219 million transformed the 180 kilometre line which now carries modern shipping containers, removing thousands of trucks from the roads. \u201cIn Southland and Otago, grants of $7 million for manufacturing businesses and a training academy aretackling local skills shortage andhelping school leavers play a part in the region\u2019s growingengineering sector. \u201cIn Rotorua, a PGF grant of $875,000 is helping to build a state-of-the-art film studio and establish training schemes to nurture the screen sector and upskill the local workforce. In Opotiki a new $112 million harbour and marine development will lead to an expanded aquaculture industry and unlock the economic potential of the town and its people. \u201cThe country\u2019s largest fishing port of Nelson is getting a fit for purpose slipway to handle larger vessels. Wairoa\u2019s rural bridges are being strengthened to handle the \u2018wall of wood\u2019 from the region\u2019s exotic forest plantations. A T\u0101upo company has government backing to develop new techniques to harvest valuable silica from geothermal steam and old mines. \u201cThis infrastructure investment is well overdue. The momentum of regional economic development is now picking up pace. We reached the $2 billion milestone just ten months after the $1 billion milestone in February 2021, which itself took three years to achieve. \u201cWhile the $2 billion achievement is impressive, it is only half the story. \u00a0 There is another $2 billion in investment in the pipeline, as K\u0101noa-RDU pays funds already allocated to projects, once they meet agreed milestones. \u201cOn top of that, the Regional Strategic Partnership Fund unveiled earlier this year is providing another $200 million as \u2018seed funding\u2019 for the regions. \u201cI am excited to watch the investment of K\u0101noa funds continue to make a difference, as we build productive, sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies across New Zealand, \u201d said Stuart Nash. Note for editorsK\u0101noa-RDU was originally established in 2018 as the Provincial Development Unit within MBIE.

The vaccine may be prescribed by a medical practitioner following the consultation and provided in line with section 29 of the Medicines Act. \u201cWe encourage eligible people to make an appointment for a free consultation with a doctor by calling Healthline. The consultation is needed as this vaccine has not yet been approved by Medsafe, the New Zealand medicines regulator. The company responsible for the vaccine is expected to apply to Medsafe shortly, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. In the initial phase, the mpox consultation service is prioritising first dose for the eligible population. Timing of the recommended second dose is a minimum 28 day interval and can be up to 2 years after the first dose. This vaccine can also be given to close physical contacts of people infected with mpox after they have been exposed to mpox. If this is within four days after first exposure to mpox it will provide the highest chance of avoiding the disease. If people think they have been exposed to mpox they should call Healthline. There have been 41 reported cases of mpox in New Zealand as of 9 January. Mpox did not get a foothold in New Zealand in 2022 like it did in other countries. This is down to the great collaboration of community organisations, public health teams, and people taking sensible steps to reduce their risk, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. Anyone with any concerns about mpox should seek advice from the place they normally receive health advice, which could be their GP, sexual health clinic or Healthline on 0800 116 672. Editor\u2019s note:The vaccine can only be made available under section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981. This allows for \u2018unapproved\u2019 vaccines to be provided to individual medical practitioners for a particular patient after assessing the patient\u2019s needs. The Act also prevents the brand name of the vaccine and volumes available being promoted due to its \u2018unapproved\u2019 status. Advertising the availability of unapproved medicines is prohibited by section 20 of the Medicines Act 1981. This means that the vaccine cannot be advertised nor its availability promoted. It can only be offered by a medical practitioner to a consumer as a proposed medical treatment and then administered after a full informed consent process.",

        "content": "APEC finance ministers will continue to work together to respond to the effects of COVID-19 and ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery while capitalising on the opportunity to build a more resilient future. The New Zealand Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson chaired the virtual APEC Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting from Wellington. \u201cWhile economic activity in the region has rebounded and vaccination rates are rising, the recovery from COVID-19 has been uneven. Some sectors, such as tourism, small and medium-sized businesses, and some groups, such as women and indigenous peoples, continue to be disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, \u201dGrant Robertson said. \u201cFinance ministers have had constructive discussions on the actions and policies APEC economies have implemented to combat the pandemic and the need for a balanced approach to preserve long term fiscal sustainability while supporting wellbeing, targeting support to where it is needed most and tackling long-standing issues of climate change and biodiversity loss. Attendees included finance ministers from all 21 APEC economies, APEC Business Advisory Council Chair Rachel Taulelei, representatives from the OECD, IMF, WBG, and ADB, and incoming APEC Finance Ministers\u2019 Process Chair Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith of Thailand. In a joint statement issued after the meeting, the APEC finance ministers agreed to use all available policy tools to address COVID and support a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive recovery; maintain macroeconomic and financial stability; refrain from competitive exchange rate devaluations; step-up efforts to expand vaccine manufacture and supply and support global vaccine sharing efforts; reiterate the importance of a free and fair trade and investment environment with the WTO at its centre; and accelerate the digital transformation. Ministers also agreed on the refreshed Cebu Action Plan strategy, which encourages economies to pay due regard toAPEC\u2019s new guiding document, the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040, and APEC\u2019s new structural reform agenda, the Enhanced APEC Agenda for Structural Reform. \u201cIt was a privilege to join with fellow APEC finance ministers to strengthen our bonds and to reflect on our collective progress to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meeting has reinforced that we have strategies and tools available to us that can continue to drive recovery while also tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of people across all APEC economies, \" Grant Robertson said. Note to editors:The Cebu Action Plan was agreed by Finance Ministers during the Philippines\u2019 2015 host year and sets out the 10-year high-level work programme of the Finance Ministers\u2019 Process. 2021 marks the year of a mandated mid-point review. The review gives an opportunity for economies to consider the impact of COVID-19 and the recently agreed Putrajaya Vision 2040. As part of the strategy refresh New Zealand has recommended the adoption of a Champion Economies model which would allow individual economies to volunteer to run multi-year work programmes on specific policy issues.",

        "content": "Auckland boundary settings to change from 15 December, ensuring travel out for all vaccinated people or those with a negative test resultCountry better prepared - 82 percent New Zealanders fully vaccinated, compared to 23 percent three months ago and projections of 90 percent fully vaccinated by mid-DecemberOn 15 December Aucklanders who have been vaccinated or tested will be able to reconnect with the rest of New Zealand in time for Christmas and summer, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today. To minimise the risk of COVID-19 spreading from Auckland to other parts of the country travellers will have to be either fully vaccinated or have a negative test within 72 hours of departure. This requirement will be in place for the core summer period of December 15 2021 to January 17 2022. \u201cAucklanders have faced restrictions for an extended period of time to keep the rest of New Zealand safe. But with increased rates of vaccination it\u2019s time to open up the ability to travel again, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cConfirming December 15 as the date the boundary requirements change provides certainty. Aucklanders can now book summer travel and accommodation with confidence and businesses inside Auckland and around the rest of the country can plan for summer travellers. \u201cThe boundary is of course two ways, so the changes also mean Aucklanders and Auckland businesses can start receiving New Zealanders from all over the country, allowing families and friends to reconnect and business to receive a much needed boost before Christmas. \u201cPolice will have operational discretion on the enforcement of these rules. Police undertake random spot checks to enforce a range of laws on our roads, such as drink driving, and will take the same approach here. \u201cOn the northern boundary, and the gateway to Northland, Police will work with Iwi to ensure people can move, but also that the people of Northland have confidence in the checks that are in place. \u201cWe have given special consideration to the South Island. The combination of the vaccine or testing requirement for Air New Zealand combined with the ability for the inter-islander to operate the same regime will provide solid measures to slow any spread to the South. \u201cCabinet will confirm on November 29 its decision to move Auckland into the new traffic light system which we expect will occur soon after the 29th. Auckland will initially move into Red, the highest level in the traffic light. \u201cWe are also confirming today that the rest of the country will move into the framework at the same time as Auckland. Those parts of the country with lower vaccination rates will move into the new system at Red, which has greater protections than the current Alert Level 2, meaning there will be stronger measures to minimise the risk of spread. \u201cThis decision carefully balances the need to give Aucklanders the ability to move and comfort to the rest of New Zealand that we\u2019re still taking steps to slow the spread of COVID. \u201cWe have deliberately set the date for the boundary restrictions to change in a month\u2019s time in order to give the rest of New Zealand time to move into the safer traffic light system and the chance to increase vaccination rates even further. \u201c82 percent of New Zealanders are now fully vaccinated compared to just 23 percent when Delta arrived three months ago, so we are in a much safer position to ease boundary restrictions. \u201cWe will be in an even safer position by mid-December when it\u2019s expected New Zealand as a whole will be around 90 percent fully vaccinated. \u201cThe steps we have taken to date have undeniably saved lives and slowed the spread of the virus that otherwise could have moved through the country very quickly. \u201cBut elimination and the alert levels were never intended as a forever strategy. High vaccination rates now offer us the ability to change our approach and move into the next chapter of our COVID response, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. The Auckland boundary will formally lift at 11.59pm Tuesday 14 DecemberPeople travelling out of Auckland from 15 December will be covered by the vaccination or testing requirement up until 17 January. Police will have operational discretion on the enforcement for these rules and perform spot checks. On the northern boundary, Police will work with iwi to ensure people can move, but also that the people of Northland have confidence in the checks that are in place. It is intended that people breaking the rules will face an infringement fine of $1,000. Checks for travellers out of Auckland Airport will be done at check-in. Air New Zealand have made a vaccine certificate or test a requirement before New Zealanders can fly, and these requirements begin on the 15th of December also. We will be enabling inter-island ferries to require proof of vaccination or a negative pre-departure test in order to travel between Wellington and Picton",

Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect your wh\u0101nau, their lives and their livelihoods. \u201cEvery New Zealander will be able to get a vaccine and the vaccine will be free. The rest of the population will be able to be vaccinated from July onwards and our plan is to have as many people as possible vaccinated by the end of the year. \u201cAs with the rest of our COVID-19 response we will make continuous improvements and adjustments to the vaccination roll-out. Our goal is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible and that will require some flexibility within the sequencing. \u201cFurther planning is underway on our ongoing response to COVID-19 including our management of the border. However the biggest factor in lifting COVID-19 restrictions will be a timely and high uptake of the vaccine, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. There are four main groups (timings will overlap, and dates might shift slightly as the Ministry continues to undertake modelling):Group 1Our 50,000 border and MIQ workers, their household contacts and the people they live with. This started last month and the vast bulk will be completed this month, with at least one dose administered. Group 2Approximately 480,000 frontline workers and people living in high-risk settings. Starting with the 57,000 healthcare workers on community frontlines, and then moving through to healthcare workers protecting our most vulnerable and some priority populations. This started in February and will continue through to May. Group 3Priority populations. Approximately 1.7 million people who are at higher risk if they catch COVID-19. This is planned to start in May. Group 4The remainder of the general population \u2013 approximately 2 million people. Starting from July. \u201cApproximately 40,000 courses are being allocated to M\u0101ori and Pacific providers who are working directly with older people, and we are also recognising the special circumstances of South Auckland, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cAnyone who lives in the Counties Manukau DHB area who is 65 and older or who has an underlying health condition is also in Group 2. This recognises that there are many border operations and MIQ facilities and their workforces based in this area. Chris Hipkins said there will be a range of options to make it as easy as possible for people to access to the vaccine. \u201cWorkers and residents of long-term residential care environments will get the vaccine at their workplace. There will also be M\u0101ori and Pacific providers, pop-up centres, GPs, medical and hauora centres, community clinics and larger scale events. \u201cAn online tool that helps people find out when they can get the vaccine will be launched shortly. It describes the four broad groups and will take people through a series of questions to work out when it\u2019ll be their turn, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThere are two further categories we are still looking at: one for people who may need to get a vaccine on compassionate grounds; and a national significance category, which could include groups who need a vaccine in order to represent New Zealand overseas. \u201cDecisions around these categories will be made at Cabinet in coming weeks. \u201d",

        "content": "With over half the eligible population now fully vaccinated and more than 80% with at least one dose, we\u2019ve all got to do our bit reach the remaining 20%, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says\u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan and to make it work we\u2019re asking everyone to contribute to a big, nationwide push for vaccination. This will culminate in a National Day of Action for vaccination on Saturday 16 October, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOn that day, we will have vaccine clinics open throughout Aotearoa all day and into the evening. A bit like Election Day, we will be asking all our political and civic leaders to contribute to a big collective effort to turn people out. \u201dAs of today half of the eligible population in New Zealand has been fully vaccinated. We\u2019ve seen 85% of Aucklanders and over 80% of New Zealanders have at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. \u201cWe all have a role to play in getting our vaccination rates up, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOur message to the 80% of the eligible population who have had their first dose is this: your job is not done. Please get your second dose, and help us reach those who have not yet come forward to be vaccinated. \u201cWe need you to be talking to them about the reasons you\u2019ve been vaccinated, we need you to make sure they are getting reliable, honest information about the vaccine. And we need you to help us to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. \u201cWe are asking our business community, our media, and our community groups to play a role too. Those that want to offer incentives to the unvaccinated to get them in the door are encouraged to do so. \u201cWe want parents and grandparents to encourage young New Zealanders to take up the opportunity to be vaccinated. We also want young people to check in with any older family members who aren\u2019t yet vaccinated, show them where they can find reliable and accurate information online, and help the whole wh\u0101nau to be protected. \u201cWe must leave no stone unturned. No one should be left behind because they haven\u2019t had the support they need to make an informed choice to be vaccinated. \u201dThere are currently 350,000 appointments available next week onhttps://bookmyvaccine.covid19.health.nz/. That doesn\u2019t include general practice, where more than 20% of people are getting their vaccines. Work is being done with District Health Boards now to increase capacity even further. \u201cOur response as a collective nation to the challenges posed by COVID-19 has been world-leading. Now we need a world-leading uptake of vaccination, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe next week and a half is critical. We need to pull out all the stops to increase our vaccination rates. It has never been more urgent. \u201d",

Ensuring Pharmac is working well as part of the total health system has been part of our plan. \u201cIn Budget 22 we made the largest single contribution to Pharmac\u2019s Medicines budget ever bringing total funding to $1.2 billion. This has already seen Pharmac launch consultations on proposals to fund medicines for conditions including cancer and multiple sclerosis. \u201cOur drug-buying system was set up nearly three decades ago and with the new health system ready to get to work come July 1, we knew it would be sensible to look at how well Pharmac is doing and ensure it is aligned with the principles of our health system rebuild. \u201cPharmac\u2019s purpose is to secure the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment from within the amount of funding provided. \u201cThe panel found Pharmac\u2019s model has delivered significant benefits, but to achieve its purpose these benefits need to be shared more equitably across our communities, especially for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cAs a result of this Review, Pharmac will have a much greater focus on improving the health of M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples, disabled people and other groups who do not yet share equitably in the benefits Pharmac provides. \u201cThis will mean stronger relationships with M\u0101ori to honour te tiriti o Waitangi, that Pharmac is more inclusive of people with health needs, and explains its work more openly for the public. \u201cThe Pae Ora Bill will put into action many aspects of the recommendations made by the Review Panel to be more collaborative, engaging and equity focused. \u201cPharmac has confirmed to me that it accepts the Panel\u2019s findings. Pharmac is committed to making the needed strategic and operational changes, and already has work underway to do this. \u201cThe panel made 33 recommendations and the government agrees in principle with most of them. There is a small number of recommendations where the government takes a different view, for example where the health reforms will address the underlying issues now or in the future, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cThe main change is that Pharmac will be required to engage more with health consumer voices and to more actively collaborate and co-ordinate with other parts of the health administration. \u201cFor example, developing a vaccine strategy is not just a matter of good procurement but needs to take account of a broader range of objectives which the Ministry of Health must be integrally involved with. \u201dPlease see the sidebar for the Government's Response and the Final Independent Review Report.",

        "content": "The Government has extended support for the international aviation sector to maintain international passenger services, remain connected with important trade partners and support the economic recovery, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced today. \u201cThe Maintaining International Air Connectivity (MIAC) scheme was due to end on 31 October 2021, but we have extended it to 31 March 2022 to help with demand over the peak summer cargo season, \u201dMichael Wood said. \u201cExtending the MIAC scheme gives us regular international air services for passengers and freight, and also protects our links to critical supplies like vaccines and medicines. It ensures we have the capability required for our businesses to tap into international markets and support our recovery. \u201cSince May 2020, temporary Government support has enabled more than 8,800 flights carrying over 169,000 tonnes of airfreight worth around $13.5 billion. During the same period, nearly 85,000 people have returned to New Zealand on supported flights \u2013 45 per cent of the total number of people to pass through MIQ facilities. \u201cWhen the pandemic first began, New Zealand could have been cut off from regular air services to the rest of the world. Even now, the number of passenger flights into New Zealand is only a quarter of its pre-COVID levels and many of those planes carry very few passengers, which shows how critical MIAC is for keeping us connected currently. \u201cTe Manat\u016b Waka Ministry of Transportis working with airlines to confirm the routes and services which will be supported over summer. I expect the exact schedule of services under the MIAC extension will be finalised over the coming weeks. \u201cGoing forward, we will reduce the level of support we provide as the Reconnecting New Zealanders strategy is implemented and border restrictions begin to ease. We expect to be able to wind down the scheme and are beginning work on how we will make this transition in a way that provides certainty and ensures that critical freight continues to flow, \u201d Michael Wood said. More informationon the MIAC scheme can be found on theMinistry of Transport websiteand exporters should contact their usual freight forwarder. Support from the MIAC scheme was originally budgeted at $170 million for 1 May to 31 October 2021. In providing the extension, the Government has agreed to an additional $195 million to support flights from 1 November 2021 to 31 March 2022. There is an additional $25 million allocated to ensure that connectivity is maintained with countries we have quarantine-free travel if there are pauses or suspensions.",

Auckland remains at Alert Level 3, Step 1. \u201cBased on the latest public health information, ministers have decided that maintaining the status quo in Northland and parts of the Waikato is the safest course of action, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThis will be reviewed by Cabinet on Monday, 18 October. \u201cThe Waikato has done a phenomenal job in getting tested and getting vaccinated. However, this morning we were informed of two new cases that are as yet unlinked to the existing cluster. \u201cHealth believes the risk from these cases \u2013 a couple \u2013 is low and there will be few locations of interest. However we need to assure ourselves that there is not undetected transmission before lowering alert levels. Genome sequencing is underway and will hopefully shed new light on these cases. \u201cUnfortunately, we still don\u2019t have confidence we have a full enough picture of the situation in Northland. \u201cGetting information from the two cases who travelled around the region while infectious and are now in quarantine, remains slow going. \u201cWe may not get any further information from contact tracing interviews so are now relying on other sources of information to piece together their movements. \u201cThe best thing people in Northland can do right now is to get tested if they have symptoms of COVID-19, even if these are mild. Over the last week, more than 7000 swabs have been taken. That\u2019s encouraging but to shift alert levels with high confidence we need even more testing over the next 5 days. \u201cIt\u2019s also great to see Northlanders coming out to get vaccinated. There have been 19,691 vaccinations in the past seven days \u2013 that\u2019s more than double the previous week. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep this going. When we see a high level of testing and vaccination, this gives us more confidence to move down the alert levels. \u201cSince the start of the Delta outbreak, of 158 people hospitalised, only 3 of those were fully immunised. This is the protection that the vaccine provides, and it is imperative that everyone who is eligible gets vaccinated as soon as possible. \u201cIf you have any contact with any positive cases, visited a location of interest or have any symptoms, get tested as soon as possible, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Key points:In Alert Level 3, you should stay home. Most people are not permitted to travel. Those who can, must carry evidence that they are permitted to travel. You can\u2019t travel into another Alert Level 3 or Alert Level 2 area without evidence of permitted travel across boundaries. The north and south Auckland checkpoints remain in place and people need to have evidence of their permitted reason to travel ready to be checked by police. Most people permitted to travel out of the Auckland region will need evidence of a COVID-19 test. Police are out in force patrolling the Waikato Alert Level 3 boundary. Those who are permitted must carry evidence that they are permitted to travel. At every airport in the Alert Level 3 areas, officials are checking that passengers have evidence of permission to travel. At Auckland Airport, most people who are permitted to travel out of the Auckland will need evidence of having a negative test.",

        "content": "European Commission President von der Leyen and Prime Minister of New Zealand Ardern met in Brussels on 30 June 2022. The encounter provided an opportunity to reaffirm that the European Union and Aotearoa New Zealand are longstanding partners with shared democratic values and interests, aligned positions on key international and regional issues, strong people-to-people ties, and a growing and mutually-beneficial trade and economic relationship. The leaders reaffirmed New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s strong commitment to multilateralism and the rules based international order. The leaders resolutely condemned Russia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and reaffirmed their unwavering support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. They urged Russia to immediately stop its indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, and withdraw all its troops and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine. They also called on Belarus to stop facilitating and supporting Russia\u2019s war of aggression. They condemned the widespread and credible reports of atrocities being committed by Russian forces, and stressed the need for ensuring accountability for the suffering and destruction in Ukraine. They called on Russia to allow immediate humanitarian access and the safe passage of all civilians concerned. They also called on Russia to immediately allow the safe return of Ukrainian individuals forcibly removed to Russia. They recalled the close coordination between the EU and New Zealand on the adoption of unprecedented sanctions against Russia and Belarus, on the diplomatic response\u00a0\u00a0in multilateral organisations, and on other forms of assistance to help Ukraine. They confirmed their commitment to address, together with like-minded partners, Russia\u2019s disinformation as well as the global consequences of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, including food insecurity. In this respect, the EU and New Zealand are committed to working together to keep food and agricultural markets open and well-functioning and to strengthen global supply chains. The leaders announced the conclusion of negotiations of a comprehensive trade agreement that includes a number of \u2018firsts\u2019. The agreement will deliver important economic, commercial and broader benefits to consumers, small and large businesses and farmers in New\u00a0Zealand and in the European Union as our economies deal with the ongoing impact of Russia\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine, and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The leaders welcomed the agreement\u2019s ground-breaking commitments on trade and sustainable development, including on the Paris Climate Agreement, core labour rights, gender equality and fisheries subsidies. The two leaders also welcomed the inclusion of a new chapter on M\u0101ori Trade and Economic Cooperation. They rated highly the liberalisation of environmental goods and services related to climate change mitigation, as well as the unprecedented cooperation arrangements to improve the sustainability of our respective food systems. They committed to completing all relevant domestic procedures without delay, so that the agreement can be signed, ratified and enter into force as soon as possible. They confirmed their support to strengthening and reforming the World Trade Organization as a central pillar of the global economic system. The leaders welcomed the completion of the ratification procedure of the EU-New Zealand Partnership Agreement on Relations and Cooperation and looked forward to its imminent application to strengthen partnership on a broad range of areas, including climate change, international peace and security, research and innovation. The leaders reconfirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow, in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets within reach and to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. They underscored the importance of accelerating immediately the development of concrete policies and measures at national level. To this end, they pledged to deepen and elevate the status of their dialogue and cooperation on climate change, including on climate finance and support for the adaptation and energy transition needs of vulnerable Pacific Island Countries, and to consider collaborating on support to Just Energy Transition Partnerships in Asian countries. They agreed to take joint work forward on climate change initiatives, such as the High Ambition Coalition and the Global Methane Pledge, as well as on emissions trading systems and the environmental integrity of carbon markets. They stressed the importance of tackling the biodiversity crisis and reconfirmed their commitment to reach an ambitious and transformational post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at COP15. The leaders affirmed the importance of an open, inclusive, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Further to the EU\u2019s adoption of its Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the leaders undertook to step up coordinated engagement with the region. Both leaders stressed the importance of ASEAN centrality in the region and of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, which uphold principles such as the rule of law, openness, freedom, transparency and inclusiveness. Recognising that climate change is the single greatest threat to the livelihood and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific, the leaders confirmed that the EU and New\u00a0Zealand are committed to promote a peaceful, stable, prosperous, and resilient Pacific. In line with Pacific-led priorities, they are committed to scale up coordination and respective efforts on climate action, good governance, human rights, sustainable development and security-related challenges, including in the context of the EU\u2019s Global Gateway investment strategy. They affirmed their readiness to share expertise and to provide assistance to affected countries and implement approaches to avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with climate change in the region. The leaders confirmed their commitment to cooperate on agriculture and announced that the EU and New Zealand will elevate their existing cooperation in an annual International Strategic Agriculture Dialogue focusing on shared challenges in agricultural trade and sustainability. \u00a0In this respect, they pledged to share experiences and best practices in this critical area of climate action and to provide support to third countries to enhance mitigation of their agriculture emissions while improving food security. The leaders confirmed that the EU and New Zealand would continue to cooperate on ocean governance to ensure the protection and sustainable use of oceans and fisheries, including to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing wherever it occurs, as well as on seabird bycatch mitigation, biodiversity in the high seas, the establishment of new Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean, and on regulating harmful fisheries subsidies. Leaders welcomed the new WTO Fisheries Subsidies Agreement, and affirmed their commitment to complete the outstanding disciplines ahead of the WTO\u2019s Thirteenth Ministerial Conference. The leaders acknowledged the excellent cooperation on Research & Innovation between the EU and New Zealand and welcomed the conclusion of exploratory talks between the European Commission and New Zealand on the country\u2019s association to Horizon Europe, the EU\u2019s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The leaders shared their expectation to see the formal negotiations launched this European autumn and concluded swiftly. With regard to COVID-19, Prime Minister Ardern acknowledged the EU\u2019s role as the most important supplier of vaccines to New\u00a0Zealand. Both leaders pledged to continue to advocate for equitable global access to and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. They also confirmed their commitment to ongoing negotiations on a new legal instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, with an empowered World Health Organization at its core. Renewing their support to the common fight against crime and terrorism, the leaders welcomed the signature today of an Agreement on the exchange of personal data between Europol and New Zealand. The agreement will strengthen law enforcement cooperation, while guaranteeing a high level of protection of fundamental rights, including data protection. Europol will be able to support the New Zealand authorities on concrete investigations, notably in fighting terrorism, organised crime, child sexual abuse and cybercrime. The leaders recalled that the EU and New Zealand promote and defend free, open, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet, the ethical and responsible deployment of digital and emerging technologies, and the realisation of human rights online, including high standards of privacy and protection of personal data. They pledged the EU and New Zealand would continue cooperation to advance responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, to address disinformation and to promote democratic resilience online. The leaders confirmed that the EU and New Zealand remain committed to addressing threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism online. They intend to continue improving their crisis response capabilities, addressing the drivers of radicalisation, including through improved transparency and management of algorithmic systems, and building an effective and diverse multistakeholder community of government, civil society and tech companies under the Christchurch Call. They look forward to attending the Christchurch Call Leaders\u2019 Summit later this year, where they expect to make further progress on these issues.",

We\u2019re already one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world \u2013 at 95 per cent of people aged 12 and over \u2013 and we can go higher still, which will make us all safer. \u201cThe first doses are anticipated to arrive in New Zealand this month and officials are working with Novavax to confirm the delivery schedule and rollout start date. \u201cIn the meantime, work is underway to prepare for the use of Novavax in the immunisation programme. This includes workforce training and ensuring logistics measures are in place to ensure that those who want to be vaccinated with the Novavax vaccine will have this option, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has welcomed Medsafe\u2019s provisional approval of New Zealand\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cThe provisional approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is a positive step in New Zealand\u2019s fight against COVID-19. It means we can now begin preparations for the first stage in our vaccination roll-out, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cMedsafe provides independent advice to the Government and approves all medicines and vaccines available in New Zealand. Approval has been a very carefully considered and robust process, with safety the key priority. \u201cMedsafe\u2019s decision is the culmination of a rigorous assessment process over many months to ensure the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is safe and effective to use here. It is informed by the most up to date medical and scientific data. We can have confidence in their decision. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in regular contact with medicines regulators around the world where the vaccine is already being rolled out. Allowing some time to study the vaccine roll-out overseas has provided extra assurance before starting our vaccination programme here. \u201cNew Zealand is in a fortunate position in not having any current community outbreaks or transmission of COVID-19. Those most at risk of getting COVID-19 will receive the vaccine first, with the broader community accessing the vaccine from the second half of the year. \u201cSubject to expected delivery of the first batch of the vaccine, we will start vaccinating first our border workers and the people they live with. People such as cleaners, the nurses who undertake health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, airline staff and hotel workers will be among the first to get the vaccine. \u201cVaccinating our frontline staff will provide a critical additional line of defence to keep them well and to help prevent COVID-19 entering the community. It\u2019s an extra layer to help protect New Zealanders and our economy against a future outbreak, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provides a green light for the first phase of the vaccination programme in New Zealand to begin. \u201cFollowing Medsafe\u2019s approval, Ministry of Health officials will give advice to the Government this week about the \u2018decision to use\u2019 the vaccine. This will essentially set out who are most suited to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, such as age ranges, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWe expect the first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines will arrive in New Zealand by the end of the first quarter, but we are making sure everything is in place in case there is an earlier arrival. \u201cOnce vaccination of our border workers starts, we expect it to be completed within two to three weeks. \u201cI want to acknowledge the global efforts towards developing this vaccine and others, which have been given to millions of people around the world, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Jacinda Ardern said the Government will be encouraging all New Zealanders to get vaccinated. \u201cI have said 2021 is the Year of the Vaccine. It\u2019s a full-year programme we have only just begun. We\u2019re not in a race to be first, but to ensure safe and timely access to vaccines for all New Zealanders. \u201cGetting vaccinated will save lives, and this is the next job of the team of five million. \u201cWe have come far in the fight against COVID; getting vaccinated is key to locking in the gains we have made and protecting our hard won freedoms. \u201dNote to editors:Provisional consent means the pharmaceutical company must meet certain conditions, including supplying more data from its clinical trials around the world as they progress. This will happen at the same time as the vaccine is rolled out. Provisional approval is not uncommon, for instance the annual influenza vaccine is given provisional approval for the same reason.",

Andrew Little was in Auckland this afternoon to see the first shipment of molnupiravir, the second oral anti-viral COVID-19 medicine to arrive in the country. \u201cAnti-virals stop people with mild COVID-19 symptoms from becoming very sick and needing to go to hospital, and because they are pills, they are easy for people to take at home, \u201d Andrew Little said. New Zealand was one of the first countries to secure access to supplies of molnupiravir. It was approved this month by medicines regulator Medsafe, and the first shipment has just arrived. \u201cVaccination is still our first and best line of defence, but it is important to have a range of treatments available for people who contract COVID-19 and are at risk of becoming seriously ill, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cWe already have four medicines \u2013 Baricitinib, Ronapreve, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab \u2013 being used in hospitals, and this month another anti-viral, Paxlovid, started being used to treat people at home. \u201cAdding molnupiravir into the mix means doctors have got a range of medicines to combat the worst symptoms of COVID-19 and protect people who are immunocompromised or have complex health conditions. It also helps prevent the health system from being overwhelmed, \u201d Andrew Little said. Another medicine, Evusheld, a prophylactic treatment which can prevent people who can\u2019t have vaccines from getting COVID-19, is awaiting Medsafe approval. All COVID-19 medicines are funded through the Government\u2019s COVID-19 fund.",

That will be followed by the ASEAN-New Zealand Ministerial Meeting on Thursday 5 August and the 28th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) on Friday 6 August, which brings in a number of additional partners from across the Indo-Pacific. All the meetings are via videoconference. \u201cThese annual meetings are of significant importance to New Zealand as we look to re-engage with the world, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cASEAN\u2019s ability to bring a range of important players together is critical for finding solutions to a range of regional issues that call for regional solutions. Key among them in 2021 are COVID-19, the need for equitable access to vaccines and how to support an inclusive and sustainable, green economic recovery. \u201cAotearoa New Zealand\u2019s participation in the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum are important for their focus on the key political, economic and security issues of interest to the eighteen members of the EAS and the twenty seven members of the ARF, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. She said that New Zealand\u2019s major policy priorities for these meetings will be the pandemic, Myanmar, and maritime issues. \u201cWe want to show solidarity with Indo-Pacific states as we tackle the challenges posed by Covid-19, and I will also be urging action on Myanmar. In addition, the tensions in the South China Sea continue to be a concern for New Zealand as they are for others, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. Last year New Zealand celebrated 45 years of relations with the ASEAN bloc. \u00a0 The breadth of New Zealand\u2019s cooperation with ASEAN reinforces the importance of partnerships across the region to advance Aotearoa\u2019s strategic interests. The Minister noted that ASEAN has underpinned decades of regional peace and stability to New Zealand\u2019s benefit and the partnership therefore continues to be vital. \u201cASEAN\u2019s ten member states together comprise New Zealand\u2019s fourth largest trading partner, accounting for 10% of our total goods exports. Economic cooperation with ASEAN extends beyond its value as an export market, as ASEAN will be a key partner for our economic recovery both as a trading partner and an advocate for upholding the multilateral trading system, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said.

We have already seen the important impact it can make through the development of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 to protect those who live here in Aotearoa New Zealand, \u201d Megan Woods said. \u201cThere is also a lot of potential to produce new vaccines, treatments and diagnostics that support wellbeing and better health outcomes in other areas such as cancer, and autoimmune and neurological disorders. \u201cRNA technology offers an opportunity to develop applications in animal health, agriculture and aquaculture.

Through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how research and science have been vital to minimise the impact of the virus on our wh\u0101nau. \u201cAn RNA platform will help put New Zealand researchers at the forefront of global efforts by increasing domestic and international collaborations. We want to make sure that New Zealand starts investing in this now, bringing together key players across the industry, and unlocking and developing international relationships. This will complement the investment the Government has already made in managing infectious disease, \u201d Megan Woods said. \u201cOn occasion New Zealand needs vaccines that can\u2019t be sourced from global suppliers, such as for meningococcal disease or rheumatic fever. Having domestic RNA capability will help us better respond to the health needs of New Zealanders, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said.

Thisfollowed the completion of the APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade Meeting chaired by Minister for Trade and Export Growth Damien O\u2019Connor early this morning. \u201cAs we face the biggest health and economic crisis of our lifetimes, I was greatly heartened to see how we united to make progress. We represent half of global GDP and wanted to use trade as a force for good, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe know nobody is safe until everybody is safe from COVID-19, and we know that our region prospers economically by keeping our markets open to one another rather than closing ourselves off. APEC Trade Ministers today agreed to:Act now to speed the flow of vaccines and vaccine-related goods by eliminating trade restrictions that increase the cost of vaccines and the goods that support them;A set of guidelines for\u00a0 their Customs authorities to ensure vaccines flow through ports and airports as quickly as possible so they are not sitting idle;Remove barriers to freight and logistics services to support trade in vaccines and vaccine-related goods to help fight the pandemic. \u201d\u201cIt is encouraging to see APEC trade ministers working together to respond in practical, concrete terms to the COVID pandemic and rebuild our economies, \u201d he said. Minister of State for Trade and Export Growth, Phil Twyford, who represented New\u00a0Zealand at the meeting, said APEC had returned to its traditional role of championingmultilateralismby:Rejuvenating the World Trade Organisation and injecting momentum into a series of trade negotiations with the aim of concluding these by the end of this year. Doubling down on a sustainable recovery by pushing the World Trade Organisation to agree governments should not pay subsidies that encourage over-fishing and to finish their negotiations by the end of July. Starting to reform subsidies to the fossil fuel industry that are contributing to the climate crisis. \u201cI would also like to acknowledge the important work led by Minister of Customs Meka Whaitiri and the New\u00a0Zealand Customs Service to publishtheBest Practice Guidelines for APEC Customs Administrations. \u201cThis was a New Zealand-led APEC initiative, which is intended to help fast track the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines so they aren\u2019t held up at borders and are distributed to people in a safe and timely manner, \u201d Phil Twyford said.

The Group will work alongside Sir Brian Roche\u2019s COVID-19 Independent Continuous Review, Improvement and Advice Group, especially around health protections post vaccine. \u201cThe members will also have a public facing role. Once advice has been considered, they will need to communicate the science behind any changes to New Zealand\u2019s border settings, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said. The Group will report to the Minister for COVID-19 Response, Chris Hipkins via Associate Minister of Health (Public Health) Dr Ayesha Verrall, who will be meeting the members regularly. The Group\u2019s chaired by Professor Sir David Skegg, and made up of the following members:Dr Nikki TurnerProf Philip HillDr Maia BrewertonProf David MurdochDr Ella IosuaRodney Jones (Special Advisor)Shaun Hendy (Special Advisor)Observer:Dr Ian Town\u201cSir David is a highly respected epidemiologist and public health physician. He has served as a special adviser to Parliament\u2019s Epidemic Response Committee during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sir David has also been an advisor to the World Health Organization in Geneva for more than three decades, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cDr Nikki Turner is a specialist in immunisation, primary healthcare and preventative child health. Professor Philip Hill is an epidemiologist with expertise in infectious diseases and research. Dr Maia Brewerton is the lead clinician at the Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergy at Auckland Hospital. Dr Ella Iosua is a biostatistical expert at the University of Otago. Professor David Murdoch is an infectious diseases expert and the Dean of the University of Otago, Christchurch. \u201cRodney Jones and Professor Shaun Hendy have been appointed as Special Advisors to the Group to assist with any modelling work that\u2019s required. \u201cProfessor Hill is also a member of the COVID-19 Independent Continuous Review, Improvement and Advice Group. He will be instrumental in making sure the two groups complement each other and their priorities align. \u201cThe Group\u2019sterm runs until 1 June 2022, \u201d Dr Ayesha Verrall said.",

The Court has said that while the Minister of Health can, under Section 23 of the Medicines Act, grant approval for Medsafe-approved medicines to be used by a limited number of patients, it\u2019s arguable whether it can be done for the whole population. Health Minister Andrew Little says Section 23 has been used over 40 years by successive Governments to grant early access to approved therapeutic substances when it is in the public good. \u201cThe law has for some time now, lacked clarity over how it can be applied, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cWe already knew the Medicines Act was out of date, which is why we were planning to replace it with a new Therapeutic Products Act. \u201cTreatments approved under Section 23 go through a rigorous Medsafe approvals process. There are occasions when the health needs of a population call for urgent access to a medicine, vaccine or treatment and we need to keep this option available for some circumstances. \u201cThere are six products currently in use under Section 23, including two types of contraceptives, two pandemic flu vaccines, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and an electrolyte solution used in hospitals, potentially affected by the decision. \u201cThe Government will introduce a Bill tomorrow to make sure New Zealanders continue to have timely access to the medicines and treatments they need. The Medicines Amendment Bill is expected to be passed under urgency tomorrow in order to protect New Zealanders early access to medicines when needed, \u201d Andrew Little said. The Therapeutic Products Bill that will replace the outdated Medicines Act is expected to be introduced into Parliament next year.",

A new tool that supports disabled people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was launched today as the country gets closer to reaching the 90 percent vaccination milestone, Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni announced. The Manaakitanga Journey is a graphic online tool that packages up key information on theUnite Against COVID-19website such as how to book New Zealand Sign Language interpreters at clinics, and how to arrange transport to and from your vaccination appointment. \u201cGetting a vaccination is the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your community \u2013 and we want all New Zealanders to have the right support to get the job done, \u201d Carmel Sepuloni said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working with the disability sector and community, Office for Disability Issues, the Ministry of Health and DHBs to develop services and information that ensures disabled people are aware of their eligibility in the vaccine programme. \u201cDeciding whether to be vaccinated, finding the most appropriate site and place to be vaccinated at and who to contact if you need transport, are all key parts of the journey that can often affect disabled people\u2019s experiences. This makes that process easier, \u201dOne in four New Zealanders identify as disabled or having an impairment. As of the 27th of October, of the 30,522 people supported by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Disability Supports Services nationwide, 82 percent have had their first dose, and 67 percent have been fully vaccinated. \u201cThe vaccination programme aims to be inclusive and accessible to all New Zealanders so that all people have the opportunity and access to a vaccination site. DHBs and local providers are really committed to getting it right for disabled people to ensure they can access the vaccine in a way that meets their needs in their local area. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing that momentum with the launch of a disability-specific part of the Unite Against COVID-19 website, which will be updated weekly with Super Accessible sites and centres for disabled people to get vaccinated at across the motu. TheUnite Against COVID-19 websitewill also contain consolidated information specifically for disabled people and those who have underlying health conditions, such as supported decision making, a list of accessible vaccination centres near you, arranging transport and information in alternative formats. \u201cI believe The Manaakitanga Journey captures the essence and importance of removing barriers to vaccination for disabled people, making it more accessible and inclusive, and as we continue to protect and look out for all New Zealanders, \u201d Carmel Sepuloni said. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will visit the Hutt Valley COVID-19 Community Vaccination Centre at 1:30pm today, to support their work as a super accessible clinic for disabled New Zealanders.",

Auckland DHB is at 95 percent first doses and 87 percent second doses. Waitemata DHB is 92 first doses and 83 percent second doses. Counties Manukau is now at 90 first doses and 80 percent second doses. Auckland will move across into the new traffic light system with fewer restrictions once all three DHBs have reached 90 percent fully vaccinated. \u201cAuckland is leading the way with vaccinations, and it is exciting to see Counties Manukau reach that all important 90 percent first dose figure, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cToday we are an important step closer to Auckland transitioning to the new traffic light system which means restrictions will ease once each DHB is 90 percent second dose. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge amount of targeted work going on by local health providers to make vaccines easily accessible and to address hesitancy. It\u2019s really pleasing to see that work paying off. \u201cIn particular the work of M\u0101ori and Pacific providers in Counties Manukau is succeeding. Getting to 90 percent first doses required pulling out all the stops in Auckland. This has included literally going door to door to ensure people are vaccinated. \u201cGetting every DHB in Auckland up to 90 percent fully vaccinated is within our reach. On current daily rates we could be there within three weeks so long as people return for their second dose. \u201cEveryone wants restrictions eased as soon as possible. We need to keep going and get those final second doses so we can ease restrictions with high rates of vaccination and high levels of confidence, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. In the last 7 days, on average Auckland residents were administered 1,743 first doses, and 6,175 second doses. Of Auckland\u2019s M\u0101ori population, 79% have received their first dose and 63% have received their second. Of Auckland\u2019s Pacific population, 85% have received their first dose and 72% have received their second dose.",

Niue has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 99 percent of its eligible population double vaccinated against COVID-19. \u00a0The recent roll out of COVID-19 vaccines to children aged between 5-11 years achieved over 95 percent coverage. From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand has supported Niue to help strengthen its preparedness and response to COVID-19, including through the provision of COVID-19 vaccines to all of Niue\u2019s eligible population groups, and wrap around support for vaccine administration. \u201cWe are honoured to have supported the Government of Niue to achieve such high coverage and welcomed the opportunity to support paediatric vaccination not only in Niue but also in the Cook Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu and Fiji, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. COVID-19 vaccines and roll-out support to Polynesian countries and Fiji are being provided through the New\u00a0Zealand International Development Cooperation funded Polynesian Health Corridors Programme which is managed by the Ministry of Health. To date, 117,300 doses of paediatric vaccines have been delivered to these 7 countries with a further 67,900 planned. Aotearoa New\u00a0Zealand has also provided wraparound technical and operational support to prepare for administering vaccines\u00a0 including assistance with strengthening cold chain systems and processes, vaccinator workforce training and support with managing adverse reactions following immunisation. In addition to supporting Niue\u2019s paediatric COVID-19 immunisation programme, 3,990 Pfizer adult doses have been provided to meet Niue\u2019s eligible adult and 16-17 year old primary and booster vaccination needs. \u201cAotearoa New\u00a0Zealand is committed to continuing to support all Polynesian countries with vaccine donations and rollout support throughout 2022 as requested, both as partners in the fight against COVID-19 and as friends and members of the Pacific family (magafaoa), \u201d Aupito William Sio said.",

The new Aotearoa Plan of Action, agreed to by all Leaders, sets out a plan for APEC\u2019s work through until 2040. \u201cThe Agenda stays true to APEC\u2019s original mission of growing trade and our economies. While it underpins prosperity in the short term, Leaders have also used the Aotearoa Plan of Action to focus on the choices that will support the Asia-Pacific\u2019s future generations, like decarbonisation and empowering our Indigenous peoples. \u201cAs New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s leadership of APEC in 2021 draws to a close, APEC has united the region in a coordinated response to the biggest economic downturn in 75 years, with a series of results that matter to New Zealanders and the region, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. APEC Leaders also issued a joint declaration which recognised that in New Zealand\u2019s host year APEC has:Rejected vaccine nationalism, with APEC members lowering tariffs on vaccines and related products to combat COVID-19, speeding them through customs, and shunning export bansDigitised trade processes to reduce paperwork and save businesses valuable time and money, with most of APEC making these measures permanentTaken practical steps to transition away from carbon, with APEC agreeing a plan to halt the increase in subsidies to fossil fuels that today amount to NZ$500 billion a yearHighlighted Indigenous economies as a driver for recovery, bringing the perspective of the region\u2019s 270 million Indigenous people inside APEC prominently for the first time everCommitted to find ways to cut red tape, reduce the cost of doing business, and make it faster to start a business. In addition to hosting the APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting, Prime\u00a0Minister Ardern spoke at the APEC CEO Summit and the Voices of the Future forum. \u00a0Together with Rachel Taulelei, she chaired a meeting of APEC Leaders with the business community. Between the Prime\u00a0Minister and APEC Ministers, bilateral meetings have been held with all APEC economies across the 2021 host year. Thailand will take over as host of APEC in 2022.",

        "content": "A million more New Zealanders over 18 will be eligible for their booster from this Friday, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today. \u201cCabinet has considered advice from the Director-General of Health and the COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group and decided to reduce the interval between a person\u2019s primary vaccination course and the booster from 4 months to 3 months \u2013 starting this Friday 4 February, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThis is a significant step in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic as it now means a total of 3,063,823 people aged 18 and over \u2013 two thirds of our population \u2013 will be eligible for their booster from this weekend. Over 1.3 million people have already got theirs. \u201cI urge every New Zealander who is eligible for a booster to get it as soon as possible. We are in a race against Omicron and the more people who are boosted the more we can reduce the impact of the outbreak. \u201cBringing forward the booster timing will help those who have been immunised more recently. It will mean more people, especially M\u0101ori, will be able to receive a booster before Omicron takes hold in communities. \u201cBoosters lower your chances of getting very sick from the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and ending up in hospital. Fewer hospitalisations from COVID-19 will mean our health systemcan continue to provide the full range of care people need, in particular for our most vulnerable such as people with disabilities or long-term illnesses. \u201cIt is also important to reduce impacts on other workforces such as those involved with the supply chain to ensure people have access to goods and services. \u201cNew Zealand is in the top 10 most highly vaccinated countries in the OECD \u2013 94 percent of us aged over 12 are fully vaccinated. That\u2019s close to four million New Zealanders, over a quarter of which have now also had their booster shot. \u201cNow is our opportunity to build on that. We have given ourselves a head start that we cannot afford to give up. \u201cIf you are over 18 and it is three months since you received your primary vaccination course, get your booster. There is excellent capacity this weekend and in the coming weeks and enough supply throughout Aotearoa for everyone. \u201cThank you to our vaccination providers and staff across the country who are working the long weekend to ensure New Zealanders have options to access their booster dose, wherever they are, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Notes for editors:The shortened booster interval to 3 months only applies to the Pfizer vaccine. CV-TAG will provide separate advice on AstraZeneca later this month. Everyone over 18 can check when they are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzor if they have one, referring to their purple COVID-19 Vaccine appointment card or calling COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Book your booster or find a walk-in vaccination centre atbookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Wh\u0101nau bookings (group bookings for more than one person) can be made by calling 0800 28 29 26. COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be available at mobile and pop-up vaccination clinics, particularly in rural M\u0101ori communities as well as marae vaccinations where a number of kaumatua received their initial doses. Interpretation services, and text, email and NZ Relay options for deaf and hearing impaired are available if you need them on 0800 28 29 26\u00a0(8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). There is also a specialist team for disabled people (option 2 on the 0800 number).",

        "content": "The Government has awarded a new round of airline support contracts through to the end of October 2021 to help keep New\u00a0Zealand connected internationally and positioned for recovery, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced today. Michael Wood said the Government moved quickly to keep critical trade flowing at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to support our economic recovery. \u201cThe previous International Airfreight Capacity (IAFC) scheme was restructured in March this year to focus on staying connected with international partners and our recovery. It allows for support levels to reduce as passenger numbers rise. \u201cAirfreight capacity is at 90 per cent of pre-COVID levels thanks to the previous scheme and its successor Maintaining International Air Connectivity (MIAC) scheme, which have helped keep trade channels open and maintain supply of time-critical goods like medicine into New Zealand. \u201cSince May last year, Government support has enabled more than 7,000 flights carrying over 136,000 tonnes of airfreight worth around $10 billion. \u201cThe scheme has also been critical for our Pacific partners \u2013 it recently supported the delivery of nearly 200,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu through the COVAX Facility. \u201cNearly 75,000 people have returned to New Zealand on flights supported by the scheme \u2013 53 per cent of the total number of people to pass through MIQ facilities. It\u2019s unlikely those journeys or the freight moved would have been possible without it. \u201cNew agreements have been reached with Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui, Korean Air, and China Airlines to maintain airfreight capacity with key international partners. The Ministry of Transport is negotiating with a number of other carriers and further announcements will be made in the coming weeks. \u201cThere was a very real possibility New Zealand could have been effectively cut off from the rest of the world. Extending support to October protects our links with the rest of the globe and gives a regular schedule of air services for passengers and freight. \u201cSecuring our recovery is a key focus for the Government and we are carefully watching the international aviation market. We will consider extending support beyond October to a final date of March 2022 if necessary, \u201d Michael Wood said. Based on forecast demand for the MIAC scheme, the Government has agreed to an additional $170 million in support to October 2021, which will be drawn from the COVID-19 support package. More information on the IAFC and MIAC schemes can be found on theMinistry of Transport websiteand exporters should contact their usual freight forwarder.",

        "content": "Halving of time overseas arrivals spend in MIQ facility to seven days followed by home isolation until they return a negative day 9 test, from 14 NovemberExpanded quarantine free travel for eligible one-way travellers from some Pacific nations, from 8 NovemberPhased easing of border restrictions will see home isolation increasingly used for vaccinated overseas arrivals in Q1 2022The Government is starting a phased easing of border restrictions that will see the time spent in an MIQ facility halved for overseas arrivals from 14 November and home isolation introduced in the first quarter of 2022 at the latest, Chris Hipkins said today. It is also expanding one-way quarantine free travel with some Pacific nations in the first step in the Government\u2019s phased plan to carefully reconnect New Zealand with the world. \u201cMIQ has served us well. Over 183,000 New Zealanders have returned home through MIQ since border restrictions were put in place last year, stopping cases at the border and allowing us to live life free of restrictions for the better part of 18 months, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWhen MIQ was introduced we didn\u2019t have the vaccine so every arrival posed a high level of risk. With most people returning now fully vaccinated the risk profile of international arrivals has changed so it is time to start changing our MIQ settings. \u201cLast week the Government announced a pathway forward out of lockdowns with the new traffic light COVID-19 ProtectionFramework that will see an easing of restrictions once the country is 90 percent vaccinated. Today\u2019s easing of MIQ requirements is part of our broader plan to re-openNew Zealand safely and reconnect with the world. \u201cThe first change we are making is halving the length of time international arrivals will need to stay in MIQ to seven days. Advice is this is the lowest risk change as the vast majority of border cases we pick up within the first seven days. \u201cThe vast majority of COVID-19 cases are picked up within the first three days of MIQ. Positive cases from border arrivals are increasingly rare, at 2 or 3 per 1000, and there\u2019s a 1 in 2000 rate of positive test results in MIQ after day seven. In addition, full vaccination will be required for all non-New Zealand travellers from 1 November. \u201cArrivals will be tested on day 0/1, day 3, and day 6/7 testing, followed by a short period of self-isolation at home \u2013 around three days. \u201cA rapid antigen test and health checks will be carried out on day seven before a person leaves MIQ, and people will get a PCR test on day 9 of their home isolation and stay at home until the result comes back. \u201cThis evolution of MIQ will initially free up more than 1500 rooms a month. These spaces will enable two things; they\u2019ll allow rooms to continue to support the Auckland outbreak and some additional rooms will be available and will add to the vouchers being released next week. \u201cShortened stays in MIQ were part of our international reconnecting plan announced shortly prior to the Auckland Delta outbreak. The move to ensure returnees are vaccinated and additional data on Delta have enabled these changes to be bought forward. \u201cThe second stage of our plan will see New Zealand moving towards having more vaccinated people able to self-isolate at home instead of in MIQ. \u201cThis option will be made available to increasing numbers of fully vaccinated travellers in the first quarter of 2022. However our priority at this stage is to safely transition to the new traffic light system first and bed that in before adding the additional risk of international arrivals immediately entering the community. \u201cWhen the COVID-19 Protection Framework is bedded in, 90 per cent of eligible New Zealanders will be fully vaccinated so we will have a higher level of confidence than we do right now of allowing international arrivals to go straight into the community. \u201cA phased approach also gives us time to evaluate the technology that\u2019ll be used to monitor home isolation compliance in the business home isolation pilot, which starts at the end of this month. \u201cFees, exemption and exception frameworks and isolate at home guidelines will be updated during the next three weeks. From 14 November, the self-isolation period for business travellers in the pilot will also be shortened to 10 days. Expansion of one-way quarantine-free travel with parts of the Pacific\u201cWe\u2019re also expanding one-way quarantine free travel from Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu to include travellers from those countries and Tokelau who have the right to reside permanently in New Zealand and people covered by border exceptions, from 8 November. \u201cTravellers must be fully vaccinated, unless they are New\u00a0Zealand citizens. RSE workers are currently required to have at least one dose, and will be required to be fully vaccinated from 1 January 2022. \u201cDue to the low risk in these countries, travellers will not need to provide a negative test before leaving or isolate on arrival in New Zealand. \u201cStandard QFT requirements will remain in place \u2013 that is, the requirement for passengers to confirm they meet health and eligibility requirements, and to complete Nau Mai R\u0101. The full list of requirements will be on theUnite Against COVID-19website. \u201cI thank the governments of these countries for their cooperation, which has led to us reaching this positive step in reconnecting our people, and the horticulture industry for the initial successful trial of QFT with Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. \u201cThe existing quarantine free travel arrangements with the Cook Islands and Niue will be maintained. \u201cThe COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, both here and abroad. We need to move quickly to make sure we\u2019re minimising the risks we face in the best way possible. We will, as we always have, step through these changes carefully. \u201cIn the meantime, my message to all New Zealanders, whether they are here or abroad, is a very simple one. Get vaccinated. This is what will ensure we can all get back to doing the things we love and seeing those we love. \u201d",

It will also reassure those who are anxious about their children attending school and early learning services. \u201cExemptions may be possible under some circumstances. \u201cWorkers at our MIQ and at airports and ports are already required to be vaccinated. Health and Disability sector\u201cThe COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Order 2021 will be updated to require anyone conducting high-risk work in the health and disability sector to be fully vaccinated by 1 December, 2021. \u201cUnder these new requirements, general practitioners, pharmacists, community health nurses, midwives, paramedics, and all healthcare workers in sites where vulnerable patients are treated (including Intensive Care Units) must receive their first dose of the vaccine by 30th October. \u201cThese requirements also include certain non-regulated healthcare work, such as aged residential care, home and community support services, kaupapa M\u0101ori health providers and Non-Government Organisations who provide health services. \u201dThe full list will be provided in the next few days. Education sector\u201cFrom 1 January, 2022, schools and early learning services and providers will need to maintain a register, and ensure only vaccinated staff and support people have contact with children and students. They need to have their first dose by 15 November. \u201cThis includes home-based educators, and all those support people in our schools and early learning services such as teacher-aides, administration and maintenance staff and contractors. \u201cSecondary schools and kura will also be required to keep a COVID-19 vaccination register for students. Students that do not produce evidence of vaccination will be considered unvaccinated. \u201cAll school employees in Auckland and other Alert Level 3 regions will be required to return a negative COVID-19 test result before they can return to work onsite. \u201cThose who are not fully vaccinated in the period leading up to 1 January 2022, will also be required to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. \u201cWork is continuing on whether mandatory vaccinations will be required in the tertiary education sector. \u201d",

Front of mind for APEC economies this year will be economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 era, navigating the economic fallout of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and other key trade issues for the Indo-Pacific region, such as demonstrating support for World Trade Organization ahead of its Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) in June. \u201cMore than ever the world needs strong multilateral rules-based systems for trade, because it benefits all countries, especially as we all recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201dDamien O\u2019Connor will also hold bilateral meetings with key ministerial counterparts and meet with New Zealand companies active in Thailand \u2013 one of New Zealand\u2019s top ten trading partners. \u201cBeing in Bangkok gives the opportunity to confirm New Zealand\u2019s commitment to free trade and growing our exports in our home region, and I am looking forward to meeting\u00a0 many counterparts in person who I met virtually during New Zealand\u2019s hosting of APEC last year, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThailand and New Zealand share a friendly relationship and we have strong trade and economic links, which we greatly value as we continue our trade-led economic recovery from COVID-19, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. The meeting will be held on 21-22 May.",

It is critical to reducing the risk of new variants emerging and setting us all on a path to recovery. Aotearoa New Zealand is committed to ensuring developing countries have access to the vaccines they need to protect against COVID-19, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. New Zealand is contributing a further 7.3 million vaccines to COVAX including 5.8 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 1.5 million doses of Janssen vaccine. This brings the total volume of New Zealand vaccine donations to COVAX to 9.7 million doses. \u201cOur latest, fully-funded dose donation to COVAX will also support vaccination programmes in developing countries, including in parts of the Pacific and in Africa where immunisation rates are low, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. This donation is supported by a grant contribution of $5.1 million to cover the cost of safe injection equipment and other ancillary costs. COVAX will allocate the doses to developing countries and deliveries will commence later this month. These donations are additional to a total of $26 million in funding contributions made to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment over the last two years. \u201cCOVAX is doing vital work to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are readily available for all. Aotearoa New Zealand was an early donor to COVAX and we remain strongly supportive of their important work, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. Through New Zealand\u2019s Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with Pfizer, paediatric vaccine doses are also being provided to countries in Polynesia. The roll out of these doses has already commenced in Niue and the Cook Islands and planning is underway for donations to Samoa, Tonga and Tokelau. \u201cWe must do all we can to increase vaccine uptake everywhere, and Aotearoa New Zealand is playing its part. Our support for roll-out of paediatric vaccines in Polynesia is part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring our Pacific wh\u0101nau have access to the vaccines they need, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. New Zealand has also already provided over 200,000 Pfizer doses from our APA to Cook Islands, Tokelau, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, in addition to the support announcedtoday.",

        "content": "Farmers and growers are getting a helping hand to prepare for Omicron, Agriculture Minister Damien O\u2019Connor announced today. \u201cThe Government has allocated $400,000 to support primary producers with contingency planning and response if a farmer or grower contracts COVID-19, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThe funding will bolster the resources of Rural Support Trusts and other organisations, including those supporting M\u0101ori agribusinesses, to help them respond to cases. \u201cThis funding will help ensure there\u2019s someone that farmers and growers can speak to and provide guidance should they or their staff be dealing with Omicron. The Rural Support Trusts are well woven into rural communities to provide wrap around support services. \u201cThe sector has to date been resilient throughout the pandemic. The hard work of farmers and growers along with those involved in keeping supply chains open and exports flowing, is leading Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s trade-led recovery from COVID-19. \u201cThe latest Situation and Outlook for Primary Industries (SOPI) shows revenue from food and fibre exports is predicted to hit a record $50 billion in the year to 30 June 2022. \u201cBut the Government is committed to keeping vital workforces going. Primary producers have always been essential workers throughout the pandemic, but as Omicron reaches further into our communities, we are stepping up to ensure we can protect the wellbeing of our rural communities. \u201cThe most important thing New Zealanders can do to prepare is to get their vaccine booster dose, before Omicron takes off in the community. \"Contingency planning by farmers, growers and lifestyle block owners will minimise the risk of further COVID-19 related disruptions, which can occur anywhere along the supply chain. \u201cIt\u2019s vital all food and fibre producers have a plan. It makes it easier for other people to step in and help run your farm, or feed your livestock, at short notice, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThere are several free checklists available which have been developed by industry and MPI. I encourage people to make use of them. \u201dWage support is also available through the Leave Support Scheme for people affected during this stage of the Omicron outbreak. \"This is available to employers, and also includes self-employed people, to help pay their employees who've been advised to self-isolate because of COVID and can't work at home during that period. \u201cIt's paid at the same rates as the wage subsidy was previously, that being $600 per week per full-time worker and $359 per week per part-time worker. \u201cOur Rural Support Trusts do great work when things are at their most difficult in the provinces. Whether it\u2019s drought, floods, or now, a pandemic. The Trusts can respond in a case-by-case basis and make sure people aren\u2019t left isolated. This includes ensuring that mental health is well-supported, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. The targeted funding is being administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and will initially be available until 1 April 2022, in line with the Government\u2019s Covid-19 response planning.

This brings the voices of these diverse communities and their lived experiences to the fore of decision making processes, \u201d says Minister for Diversity, Inclusion and Ethnic Communities Priyanca Radhakrishnan. \u201cLed by Chief Executive Mervin Singham, the Ministry has focused on areas that ethnic communities told us were important. These include employment, government services that are responsive to the needs of ethnic communities, financial support for community initiatives and the response to COVID-19. \u2018The Ministry established a Graduate Programme that has placed skilled graduates from ethniccommunities in policy roles across government agencies. This has provided them with a meaningful first employment opportunity and enhanced diversity in policy making and the design of government services. \u201cI am committed to improving ethnic representation on public sector boards. The Ministry\u2019s Nominations Service maintains a database of qualified, ethnically diverse people who are seeking an appointment to a public sector board. The Ministry is now working with other partners such as the Super Diversity Institute and Leadership NZ to expand this pool of ethnic nominees and help us create a sustainable pipeline of diverse governance candidates for appointment to state sector boards. \u201cFollowing a substantial increase in funding, in the year to date, the Ethnic Communities Development Fund disbursed $4.2 million in support of 310 community projects and initiatives that helped celebrate different cultures and strengthened social cohesion. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s work to support the government\u2019s response to COVID-19 included working with the Ministry of Health to implement a vaccine roll out for and led by ethnic communities. This included supporting communities with translated material, running a series of community hui and commissioning a media campaign in ten languages. In addition, the Ministry administered $4 million in funding for community initiatives to support efforts to increase vaccination within their communities. \u201cThe Ministry has had a successful first year and this is just the beginning. There is a lot more to do. This Government wants to create a more cohesive Aotearoa New Zealand where everyone feels safe, valued, heard and can participate fully, \u201d says Priyanca Radhakrishnan. \u201cThe work of the Ministry will help take us there. \u201d",

        "content": "The largest shipment of the Pfizer vaccine to date has arrived into New Zealand two days ahead of schedule, and doses are already being delivered to vaccination centres around the country, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. \u201cThe shipment of more than 370,000 doses reached New Zealand yesterday, following a complex logistical exercise carried out jointly by Pfizer, DHL and the Ministry of Health\u2019s logistics team, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe arrival came after some dedicated work got the vaccines onto an earlier than expected connecting freight flight from Singapore. The Ministry\u2019s logistics team then worked through the weekend to coordinate with the flight schedule and be ready for the vaccine\u2019s arrival into Auckland International Airport. \u201cThe shipment was processed immediately at our Auckland depot, which means deliveries could be sent smoothly and efficiently to district health board sites where the stock buffer was the smallest. \u201cThe team work also ensured everything was set up for delivery to other sites from first thing this morning. \u201cFifteen sites received shipments from the newly arrived stock yesterday, while 104 will receive stocks of the vaccine today, a day earlier than planned. \u201cTeams on the ground in DHBs have been managing their stocks but towards the end of last week, margins were again getting tight in some of our larger population areas. \u201cThis big delivery \u2013 with further significant shipments to arrive during the final two weeks of July and into August \u2013 is a massive boost for the national programme. \u201cDemand for the vaccine continues to be high, particularly in our bigger cities, and we\u2019ve consistently said we want to have the doses out of storage and into arms. \u201cWith the rollout continuing to sit at around 6 percent ahead of plan, it\u2019s important we continue to do everything we can to get supply out to vaccination centres as quickly as possible. \u201cWe expect this momentum to continue over the remainder of July and into August, with Pfizer having committed to deliver more than 1.5m doses into New Zealand next month. \u201cThat\u2019ll represents our biggest monthly delivery to date and is fantastic news for the ongoing ramp up of our roll-out. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to manage and monitor vaccine supplies coming into the country against increasing demand as the vaccination programme gathers momentum, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.

Two weeks ago the Government set out the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out plan \u2013 beginning with those most at risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 and those most at risk of getting seriously sick from it. \u201cThe Government has carefully considered circumstances where there is a genuine need for people to be vaccinated urgently in order to travel overseas, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cA high threshold has been set, which will balance compassion with the need to avoid potential queue jumping ahead of at-risk groups, without a strong justification. These provisions will not extend to vaccinations for new arrivals or returnees. \u201dEven before people will be considered, they will need to satisfy a series of criteria, including being a New Zealand citizen, resident or visa holder; needing to travel before 31 August 2021; and having already made arrangements for returning to New Zealand. \u201cPeople should also ensure they will be able to receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine prior to their departure, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. The compassionate grounds that would be considered for travel overseas include:needing to provide critical care and protection for a dependant;accessing critical medical care that is not available in New Zealand; andvisiting an immediate family member who is dying. \u201cThis does not include reuniting with family, attending a funeral or memorial service, or attending a school or university. \u201dNational significance overseas travel will include representing New Zealand:in an official capacity;at significant international events; andin an official non-government capacity. \u201cThe key yardstick here is people travelling in an official capacity and ensuring their participation is in our national interest. We also expect these requests will need to be made by the appropriate agency or association on behalf of the individual, not by individuals themselves. \u201cIt does not include private or recreational travel. \u201cThe final consideration is the level of risk travellers will be exposed to COVID-19 in the destination country. \u201cUnderlying these decisions is a fundamental recognition that while where there are legitimate urgent reasons to travel overseas, it is also in all our interests to ensure New Zealanders are protected against COVID-19 to the best extent possible when travellers return home, \u201d Minister Hipkins saidFurther information about the new criteria and application process for an advanced vaccine request will be available in the coming week, before applications open 31 March.",

        "content": "A second batch of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines arrived safely yesterday at Auckland International Airport, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. \u201cThis shipment contained about 76,000 doses, and follows our first shipment of 60,000 doses that arrived last week. We expect further shipments of vaccine over the coming weeks, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cAs with the first shipment, quality assurance and checks by Medsafe are underway. \u201cBy the end of March, we\u2019re due to receive a total of about 450,000 doses \u2013 enough to vaccinate 225,000 people with a two-dose course. \u201cThe Ministry of Health is working with Pfizer/BioNTech to develop a delivery schedule for the vaccines that ensures a smooth rollout and scaling up of our immunisation programme as we rollout to the general public in mid-year. \u201cWe started our immunisation programme to around 12,000 border and managed isolation and quarantine workers last Saturday, and once completed, we\u2019ll begin vaccinating their household contacts, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Meanwhile, around 40 border workers from Christchurch Airport were vaccinated this morning, the first to do so in the South Island. \u201cThis passes a milestone of the first 1000 border workers and vaccinators in New Zealand to receive their first dose. That\u2019s a great start and we appreciate the effort of the vaccinators and border workers, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThey included aviation security workers, cleaners, police, customs workers and health protection officers who screen passengers arriving on international flights. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasing to see the gradual scale up of vaccines being administered among this tier one group, as planned, as processes at each site are fine tuned. Numbers will start to pick up from here. \u201dChris Hipkins said a shipment of 490,000 special-purpose needles also arrived yesterday to New Zealand, which will help vaccination teams maximise safe usage of the vaccine. \u201cMaking the most of every vial of the vaccine and avoiding waste will help to ensure the successful rollout of our immunisation programme, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta and Defence Minister Peeni Henare have announced a Medical Assistance Team will head to Niue on a NZ Defence Force C-130 Hercules tomorrow, after the Niuean government requested New Zealand support. The first quarantine-free passenger flight from New Zealand arrived in Niue on 27thJune, and positive cases were detected the following day as part of mandatory day-one testing for the passengers. \u201cNiue has had considerable success in keeping out COVID-19. We know from our own experiences how challenging it is to deal with this virus, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cAotearoa New\u00a0Zealand has provided support to Niue since the outset of the pandemic, including economic support, assistance for its vaccine programme, support from a principal health adviser, and advice across health and border policy settings. \u201cNiue has enviable vaccination rates. Around 99 percent of those aged over five years are double vaccinated, and 93 percent of those over 18 years are boosted. These vaccination rates will help provide a strong defence against this virus. \u201cIn line with our shared planning for a response, a public health physician from the Polynesian Health Corridors programme and a laboratory technician from Pacific Pathology Training Centre are travelling to Niue today, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cTomorrow, a New Zealand Medical Assistance Team of doctors, nurses and logistics personnel will be deployed on the NZDF Hercules to support the Niuean health system. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and additional rapid antigen tests are also being supplied to supplement Niue\u2019s existing stores, \u201d Peeni Henare said. \u201cIn addition, a New Zealand Defence Force team of five personnel will also travel to Niue to provide medical planning and logistics expertise to directly support the Niuean Government\u2019s response. \u201cThe NZDF always stands ready to work alongside our partners across the Pacific, and New Zealanders can be proud that our Defence Force will play its part as Niue responds to the increase in COVID-19 cases, \u201d Peeni Henare said. \u201cAll New Zealand-based travellers in Niue should follow local guidance and register their details with www.safetravel.govt.nz. Tourists and business travellers to Niue are required to have travel insurance to meet costs for medical treatment and travel delays. They must stay in place if isolating. We are committed to supporting Niue as it responds to this outbreak, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said.",

        "content": "Vaccination will be required for all workers at businesses where customers need to show COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates, such as hospitality and close-contact businesses. New law to introduce a clearer and simplified risk assessment process for employers to follow when deciding whether they can require vaccination for different types of work. Non-vaccinated workers in roles requiring vaccination will be given a new four-week notice period to get vaccinated before employment can be terminated. Employers to be required to provide paid time off for workers to get vaccinated and will need to keep records about workers\u2019 vaccination status. The Government is introducing a range of measures to help protect workplaces and workers from COVID-19, Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Michael Wood announced today. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard the calls from employers and employees to provide certainty on what roles need to be done by vaccinated workers under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, \u201d Michael Wood said. \u201cWe\u2019re mandating vaccination for workers at businesses where customers need to show COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates to make those workplaces as safe as possible and give confidence to staff and customers. \u201cThe timing of this coming into force will depend on when we move to the COVID-19 Protection Framework. We\u2019re working with the CTU and BusinessNZ to make sure we will have robust guidance for businesses ready well in advance. \u201cA number of businesses have already gone through a risk assessment process to mandate vaccinations at their workplace, but we\u2019ve had calls from both businesses and unions to make this process as clear as possible. That\u2019s why we will introduce a risk assessment process in law for employers to follow when deciding whether they can require vaccination for different types of work. \u201cWe know though that many businesses and employers who are not covered by vaccine certificates want greater clarity on whether they can mandate vaccines. This process will provide businesses with a clear and simplified legal framework to make decisions about requiring staff to be vaccinated or not. \u201cThis risk assessment will build on the guidance provided by WorkSafe, with input from public health officials, business representatives and unions. It will cover factors like whether a workplace involves interaction with customers. \u201cThis new process won\u2019t override risk assessments that businesses have already done under the existing health and safety guidelines. \u201cWe know that these changes raise questions around what happens when mandated employees refuse to get vaccinated. To provide clarity, a new four-week notice period will apply if their employment is terminated if they choose not to be vaccinated and their work requires it. \u201cOur law change will require a minimum of four weeks\u2019 paid notice for any employee who loses their job because they are not vaccinated. \u201cThis change will only apply to employees who do not have a notice period, or whose notice periods are shorter than four weeks. Most employees will have notice periods in their employment agreement. \u201cEmployers will also be required to keep records about workers\u2019 vaccination status. MBIE will work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to provide practical guidance on how to ensure workers\u2019 records are handled appropriately. \u201cWe understand the urgency and we expect these changes to be in place to align with the COVID-19 Protection Framework coming into force. \u201cWe will pass this legislation as a priority to give workplaces the certainty they need, because vaccination is one of the best tools to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading, \u201d Michael Wood said.",

        "content": "$37 million towards national integrated farm planning system for farmers and growers. $24 million towards agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation research and development. $900,000 to collect vital statistics on agricultural production, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The Government is backing initiatives to help reduce costs for farmers and growers, boost returns, and help achieve lower on-farm emissions. \u201cTo meet our climate change and sustainability goals we need a single national farm planning framework that is easy for farmers and growers to use and that integrates with their business requirements, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. \u201cA national training programme will deliver more skilled farm advisers and an accelerator fund will invest in targeted initiatives to significantly broaden the uptake of integrated farm planning. \u201cIt will ensure up to 40,000 farmers and growers have the tools they need to improve on-farm performance and meet freshwater and greenhouse gas requirements by 2025, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said. New funding will also boost research and development in technologies to reduce agricultural emissions. This could include promising areas like vaccine development, methane and nitrous oxide inhibitors, and low emissions animal breeding. \u201cWe\u2019ve set a clear objective for agriculture in He Waka Eke Noa for 100 percent of farms to have written plans to measure and manage emissions by December 2024. As the saying goes, what gets measured, gets done. \u201cThis Budget commitment and subsequent ones by Labour will deliver lasting reductions in both agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the associated costs. We\u2019re enabling faster development and broad uptake of new technologies on Aotearoa New Zealand farms. \u201cNew funding will also enable Aotearoa New Zealand to continue collecting vital information as part of the Agricultural Production Statistics. This includes measuring progress towards meeting our domestic and international greenhouse gas reporting and forecasting. \u201cAs an agricultural nation, there is a lot riding on our ability to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cA key goal of ourFit for a Better World \u2013 Accelerating our Economic Recoveryroadmap launched last year is cutting biogenic methane emissions to between 24 and 47 percent below 2017 levels by 2050 \u2013 this includes reducing them to 10 percent below 2017 levels by 2030. \u201cThis new Budget investment will supercharge and streamline efforts. Getting the right result will actually add value to our exports. High-value consumers abroad want to know they\u2019re buying food and fibre that are quality, ethical and sustainable. \u201cAotearoa New Zealand has to move from volume to values \u2013 that is, aligning our story with the values of our consumers, \u201d Damien O\u2019Connor said.",

        "content": "New Zealand is seeing a drop in cases, but as Omicron takes hold in our regions, public health advice tells us now is not the time for the country to move to Orange, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see fewer cases. Yesterday was the lowest number we\u2019ve seen since 25 February, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cFour weeks ago we were averaging around 20,000 cases a day, compared to today where that average is just over 13,000. But while the drop in cases is mainly in Auckland and Wellington, other places aren\u2019t yet in the same position. \u201cHospitalisations have dropped in Auckland, but continue to plateau in regions like Canterbury, Waikato and Northland. \u201cAs a result, the public health advice is that it is not yet the time to ease the existing restrictions and drop down to Orange. Ministers will review these settings again next week. \u201cWe have put this check in place due to the pace at which we are seeing the COVID-19 situation changing, and acknowledging that Easter and the upcoming school holidays are an important time for businesses \u2013 particularly those in our tourist regions, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. As we\u2019ve learned over the last two years, keeping ourselves and each other safe from COVID-19 continues to be a team effort. \u201cNearly two weeks ago we announced changes to the COVID-19 Protection Framework to make it simpler and allow us to live more normal lives, while keeping the public health measures in place that we know work. We also announced changes to vaccine passes and mandates, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cAt 11:59pm tonight, Kiwis will no longer need to use My Vaccine Pass. This was an extremely useful tool while we were getting the country vaccinated and in our fight against Delta, but with around 95% of the eligible adult population at least double dosed, we no longer need this. Businesses will still be able to use the system if they choose to but from tonight, it\u2019s not required. \u201cGovernment vaccine mandates for all sectors except health and care workers, prison staff, and border workers will be removed from tonight. They remain for health and care workers and prison staff because they come into contact with a lot of people who are at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19, and for our border workers because they are the first people who would likely be exposed to any new variant of concern that emerges internationally. \u201cOur COVID-19 response has always prioritised the health of kiwis by ensuring we\u2019re protecting our immunocompromised and high-risk members in our communities. \u201cRed means wearing a face mask in most indoor settings, limiting indoor capacity to 200, and if you catch COVID-19 \u2013 or someone you live with does \u2013 isolating for 7 days. \u201cNext to being vaccinated and having a booster, face masks are our best defence against COVID-19. Wearing them can reduce new cases of the virus by as much as 53%. That means by putting on a face mask you are contributing to lowering our case numbers, lowering the numbers of people in hospital, and lowering the number of deaths, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

This has been helped by a big surge in boosters and a healthy uptake in tamariki aged 5 to 11 years old having their first paediatric dose, \" Chris Hipkins said. \"The number on its own tells a great story. But it's what it signifies for the people in our country that\u2019s the most important factor. \u201cTen million vaccines, including more than 1.7 million boosters, means our communities already have a good level of protection against Omicron \u2013 with more to come. Every single one of our DHBs has now reached 90 per cent of their population having received at least one vaccine dose. \"Kiwis have really pulled together to protect each other with 95 per cent of people aged over 12 now fully vaccinated \u2013 one of the highest rates in the world. Sixty-one per cent of people over 18 who are due for a booster have already had one \u2013 and this is climbing quickly. \u201cThis is a major logistical achievement and the milestone is testament to the DHBs, hundreds of pharmacies, GPs, hauora, community providers and mobile clinics and other sites that have given the vaccine to everyone from our old to our young. \u201cThe advocates and workers on the ground who work with those in our hardest-to-reach communities also deserve huge recognition. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s the people of New Zealand who have embraced the science and put their trust in the health system who deserve the biggest accolade. They should take a bow, and then take a breath and continue to encourage others to get vaccinated. \u201cA strong booster uptake in all our communities is our best defence against the Omicron variant. Being fully vaccinated is great, being boosted is even better. \u201cBook your vaccine now, whether it\u2019s your first, second or booster. Every dose counts. \u201cThe \u2018Big Boost\u2019 campaign continues this weekend, promoting the booster dose to anyone 18 and over who has had their second dose more than 3 months ago. \u201cMany vaccination centres will be open extended hours over the weekend to encourage people to get their booster, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.

But we also need our health system to have sufficient capacity and support to maintain effective levels of contact tracing and testing, and for managed isolation and quarantine facilities to be fully resourced for our overall elimination strategy to work. \u201cThat requires cash injections for the Ministry of Health, DHBs and agencies working at the quarantine facilities to provide funding certainty. \u201dFunding agreed by Cabinet will pay for a series of COVID-19-related health activities to June 2022, including:Maintaining up to 7000 tests a day including swabbing and laboratory services. Contact tracing, supplies of PPE and supporting technology. Additional support for the Ministry, and for DHBs on an as-needed basis. The additional funding of $1.12 billion adds to the $251 million injection provided to health in October. Further additional funding of $1.74 billion, split across the agencies involved, will ensure the MIQ operating model is fully resourced up to June 2022, including the costs of accommodation, transport, food, security and health and wellbeing services. \u201cThese are significant investments that are critical to keeping our defences strong. Keeping COVID-19 out and quickly managing any incursions that do occur is an expensive business but it\u2019s the best investment we can make for our health and our economy, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cAs well as continuing high levels of frontline delivery, the extra health funding will enable the Ministry to enhance its oversight and policy roles and other activities through a new COVID-19 Response Directorate and to continue to make improvements to the way it operates. That includes a focus on improved Information Technology. \u201cNew functions being developed include a greater role in research, more capacity to undertake infection, prevention and control audits and a beefed up policy and strategy unit, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Further improvements to the response administration and governance\u201cThroughout our response to COVID-19 so far, we\u2019ve adopted a mind-set of driving constant review and improvement in the face of an unpredictable and fast evolving situation, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe system of multiple interconnected agencies and portfolios is complex but has stood up well overall. Continual improvements have and continue to be made \u2013 but making substantial changes at the same time as focusing on keeping COVID-19 out has been a challenge. \u201cWith much-improved testing, contact tracing and border control now in place however, the Government is in a position to consolidate and strengthen administration and governance of the response. \u201cThis is increasingly essential to meet the added complexity of keeping New Zealanders safe, implementing the biggest immunisation programme in our history, while further stimulating the economy and managing a staged opening of our borders. \u201dThe updated approach, to be in place by March 2021, involves:Strategic leadership and central coordination to be led by a COVID-19 Response unit, building on existing all-of-government functions in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The public health response, including strengthened surveillance and testing, and public health advice, to be managed by the Ministry of Health. End-to-end management of our borders, including links to MIQs, led by a Border Executive Board of interdepartmental chief executives. Lessons learned and progress on surveillance, testing and contact tracingIn August, the Government established an Advisory Committee, chaired by Sir Brian Roche and Heather Simpson, to review testing and surveillance systems and propose improvements. This was followed in October by a review of contact tracing performance, also led by Sir Brian Roche. \u201cThe reports are independent and between them contain 28 recommendations, of which 25 are for the Ministry of Health, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOverall, the Committee found that by the time the reports were being written, the required improvements, including border testing, were under way. \u201cCabinet has this week considered an update from the Ministry and other agencies on progress against the recommendations. Actions on five of the recommendations have been completed, with 23 underway. \u201cThe Ministry has all year been at the heart of a massive response to a global pandemic that a year ago no-one could have foreseen, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cIt has continued to improve and adapt its response to COVID-19, while delivering on its many other obligations. New Zealanders should have confidence in the containment of recent community cases to date as a result of a stronger Ministry response and the hard work of public health units, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "Vaccination rollout will speed up, with all eligible ages able to book in their vaccine by 1 SeptemberMove to 6 weeks between doses to ensure more NZers at least partially vaccinated as soon as possible in face of Delta riskPhased approach to reopening border with self-isolation pilot this year and set up of new testing and vaccine checking systems at borderFrom the first quarter of 2022 move to new individual risk based border settings that will establish low, medium and high risk pathways into the countryElimination retained as best strategy to keep COVID out and economy openThe Government will use the second half of 2021 to vaccinate as many New Zealanders as possible and safely conduct a self-isolation trial for vaccinated New Zealanders in order to prepare for a phased resumption of quarantine-free travel, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today. The Government\u2019s framework for re-opening borders and moving to an individualised risk-based model for quarantine-free travel was unveiled at a forum on Reconnecting New Zealanders to the World in Wellington today. The release of the plan followed the publication of Sir David Skegg\u2019s Strategic COVID-19 Public Health Advisory Group\u2019s advice to Government on Wednesday. \u201cGetting vaccinated is the number one thing everyone can do to be protected against COVID-19, help accelerate our economic recovery, reduce the risk of lockdowns, and safely allow New Zealand\u2019s borders to begin re-opening next year, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThe plan announced today is informed by the best available scientific evidence and public health advice. It will allow us to capture the opportunities vaccination brings, while protecting the gains New Zealanders have worked so hard for. \u201cKey to this is maintaining our Elimination Strategy. The advice is clear: If we open our borders now we will lose the freedoms and advantages we have achieved so far. \u201cIf we give up our elimination approach too soon there is no going back, and we could see significant breakouts here like some countries overseas are experiencing who have opened up early in their vaccination rollout. \u201cTherefore the first step in our plan is speeding up the vaccination process to ensure everyone is at least partially vaccinated as soon as possible to reduce the risk and impact of Delta entering the country. \u201cFrom today we are moving to a six week period between doses, meaning more people can get their first dose quicker and ensuring everyone is at least partially vaccinated in the coming months. Those who work at our border, have underlying health conditions or wish to be fully vaccinated sooner can still get their second dose after three weeks. \u201cWe are also bringing forward the eligibility dates for the remaining groups. As already announced 50 plus will be open from Friday 13th August, 40 plus will be open on Wednesday 18th August, 30 plus will be open on Wednesday 25th August and from 1 September we will be open for all eligible ages. \u201cOnce enough people are vaccinated, we will be able to start the next step in the plan: a phased introduction of an individual risk-based approach to border settings in 2022. \u201cLow-Risk, Medium-Risk and High-Risk travel pathways will be created, and which pathway a traveller takes will be based on the risk associated with where they are coming from and their vaccination status. \u201cEach pathway will have testing and isolation requirements proportionate to that risk. \u201cThe Low-Risk pathway will permit quarantine free entry for vaccinated travellers who have been in low risk countries. \u201cThe Medium-Risk pathway would include a combination of self-isolation and/or reduced MIQ for vaccinated travellers who have been in medium risk countries. \u201cTo prepare for the Medium-Risk pathway the Government will run a self-isolation pilot in the second half of this year to test processes and systems for the safe use of this tool. \u201cBusinesses and organisations that need to send staff overseas will be invited to express interest in participating in the pilot which will run between October and December 2021. \u201cThe High-Risk pathway will see the continuation of a full 14 days in MIQ and testing for unvaccinated travellers and any traveller, including vaccinated travellers, who have been in very high risk or high risk countries. \u201cThis individual risk based approach requires new systems to be set up. We will use the remainder of 2021 to continue to prepare for the operation of borders under this system. \u201cThis work includes ongoing work on the development of a traveller health declaration system, investigating new testing technology for rapid testing on arrival at airports and reliable pre-departure testing as well as piloting self-isolation arrangements for some New Zealanders and strengthening other public health measures such as contact tracing. \u201cNew Zealand remains in a strong position. We don\u2019t have COVID in the community and our economy is more open than most. \u201cOur plan to reopen our borders both protects the gains we have won, while setting us up to safely reconnect New Zealanders and business with the world and seize the opportunities created by our COVID success, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

        "content": "A new transition payment will be made available particularly for affected businesses in Auckland, Waikato and Northland to acknowledge the restrictions they have faced under the higher Alert Levels. Transition payment of up to $24,000 as businesses move into traffic light systemLeave Support Scheme and Short Term Absence Payment available under new frameworkFurther targeted support will be considered once framework beds inRSP adjusted to support recently acquired businesses\u201cThe one-off transition payment will be activated through the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) system criteria and be available on December 10, \u201d Grant Robertson said. This payment is at a higher base rate than the current RSP and will be $4,000 per business plus $400 per FTE up to a cap of 50 FTEs \u2013 a maximum payment of $24,000. Treasury has estimated the likely total cost of the payment to be between $350 and $490 million. The affected revenue period for the Transition Payment will be set between October 3 and November 9, and must be compared to a typical week in the six weeks prior to August 17. This payment is a recognition of the long period of time businesses in Auckland in particular have spent with restrictions in place prior to shifting to the new framework. \u201cAs I said last month we are moving away from the broad based economic supports provided under the Alert Level system. This is because at all levels of the new framework, most businesses will be able to operate at almost full capacity, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cOn Friday the final Wage Subsidy and RSP opened for applications. These will still open, and pay out even though we are moving to the new framework, in addition to the transition payment. \u201cSupport to be off work while isolating or to take leave while waiting for test results, currently provided by the Leave Support Scheme (LSS) and the Short Term Absence Payment, will remain available under all levels of the traffic light system. \u201cHowever, the LSS will move to a weekly payment rather than fortnightly under the new system, reflecting the changed isolation period. \u201cWe will monitor any economic impacts the new system may be having on businesses. I expect to report back to Cabinet in early 2022 on this and will make recommendations for support as necessary. \u201cTo be clear about this, if it is deemed necessary targeted support would only be available under the Red setting of the new system as businesses that operate vaccine passes have no significant restrictions at Orange and Green. Cabinet has also agreed to change the rules so recently acquired businesses can access the Resurgence Support Payment. \u201cThis issue arose because the RSP rules required the applicant to have been operating as a business for at least one month before August 17 so businesses acquired after July 17 have not been eligible for any payment. \u201cI estimate very few businesses have will been in this situation, but for those that are, it will have been a difficult time. \u201cThe test will now be that the business itself must have been in operation for at least one month prior to August 17 and the business must be carrying on the same or similar activity as before the change in ownership. \u201cThe revenue decline test also needs to be amended to allow the applicant to use the revenue received by the previous owner over the comparator period in order to demonstrate the necessary revenue decline during the affected period, \u201d Grant Robertson said. The change will come into effect on December 10 and recently acquired businesses would then be eligible for RSPs made on and after October 29.",

Marise Payne\u2019s visit is the first official visit to New Zealand by Australia since both countries imposed border restrictions in response to COVID-19 in March 2020. The Ministers welcomed the chance to meet in person for the first time, following the commencement of two-way quarantine-free travel on 19 April. The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss ways to continue and deepen cooperation between Australia and New Zealand to meet the shared challenges facing our region. New Zealand and Australia stand together in facing a challenging global environment. Ministers discussed the importance of promoting our shared interests in an open, resilient and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They reaffirmed their intent to work together to preserve the liberal international order that has underpinned stability and prosperity in the region, and to foster a sustainable regional balance where all countries- large and small \u2013 can freely pursue their legitimate interests. The Ministers discussed responses to increasing pressure on the international rules-based system and rising protectionism, and agreed on the need for coordinated regional and global action on issues such as human rights and climate change, including work Australia and New Zealand are doing together to strengthen the climate resilience of our Pacific island partners. The Ministers also highlighted the importance of strengthening gender equality, including promoting women in leadership in the Pacific and initiatives on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Minister Payne and Minister Mahuta agreed on the value of coordinating with other likeminded countries and building broad coalitions on issues of common interest. Ministers also reiterated both governments\u2019 commitment to a resilient and united Pacific region underpinned by robust regional architecture, and to continuing to help Pacific island countries manage the health and economic impacts of COVID-19, including support for the rollout of vaccines. The two Ministers welcomed progress on the Australia-New Zealand Single Economic Market agenda. They acknowledged the contribution quarantine-free travel would make to the economic recovery in both countries, especially in the travel and tourism sectors. The Ministers also discussed the situation of New Zealanders living and working in Australia. The Ministers reaffirmed the closeness and importance of the Australia-New Zealand relationship. \u201cAustralia is New Zealand\u2019s closest and most important international partner. It\u2019s appropriate that Minister Payne was the first counterpart I have welcomed from overseas since becoming Foreign Minister\u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. \u201cNew Zealand also looks forward to welcoming Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for our annual leaders\u2019 talks. \u201dMarise Payne expressed appreciation for New Zealand\u2019s warmth and hospitality. \u201cI look forward to continuing our strong tradition of trans-Tasman partnership, working closely with Minister Mahuta to promote even closer economic ties and personal connections between Australia and New Zealand. \u201dENDS",

        "content": "A new M\u0101ori language prediction tool will play a key role in tracking our te reo M\u0101ori revitalisation efforts, Minister for M\u0101ori Development Willie Jackson announced today. He Ara Poutama m\u014d te reo M\u0101ori(He Ara Poutama) can forecast the number of conversational and fluent speakers of te reo M\u0101ori from now until 2040, using a computer-generated statistical technique. Willie Jackson said being able to see the impact of our language revitalisation efforts and see our progress through a forward-looking lens was a powerful tool. \u201cWe all need to do our bit to ensure te reo M\u0101ori is a thriving and living language and it\u2019s heartening to see this happening across the motu. He Ara Poutama is clear, what we do now will have implications for years to come, \u201d Willie Jackson said. He Ara Poutama was a Te Whare o te reo Mauriora shared research project that was led by Te Taura Whiri i te Reo M\u0101ori, Te M\u0101t\u0101wai and Ministry of Education. A summary report on the He Ara Poutama tool findings will be published next month. Willie Jackson said the tool was a great example of collaboration across the M\u0101ori language sector and would be important for helping research and decision-making within Te Whare o te Reo Mauriora. \u201cFor example, He Ara Poutama shows, that for rangatahi, both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori, having a speaker of te reo M\u0101ori in the home is the biggest way to get them more likely to speak conversational te reo M\u0101ori. \u201cWe must identify more opportunities to grow te reo M\u0101ori used in homes and communities. It will be critical to collaborate with Te M\u0101t\u0101wai because it is this entity which is generating critical insights from iwi and wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori. \u201dWillie Jackson said it was important to strengthen the pipeline of M\u0101ori language learners and gain traction towards our M\u0101ori language goals together in Aotearoa. \u201cEngari ki te kotahi te k\u0101kaho ka whati. Ki te k\u0101puia e kore e whati! If we stick to this and come together it can only be a good thing for us all. \u201cCan I also take this opportunity to encourage everyone to book and get their vaccine against Covid-19. Do it for yourself and do it for your wh\u0101nau, \u201d Willie Jackson said.

Vaccinating more people from the flu will save lives, preserve capacity in our hospitals, and is a part of our plan to get through the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201d Andrew Little said. The flu vaccine can be safely administered at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine - whether that be a booster shot or paediatric vaccine. There is no requirement to have a gap between the COVID-19 vaccine and any other vaccine except for the Zostavax shingles vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019s so important we continue to do what we can to protect our most vulnerable and this is another way that we can keep New Zealanders safe, \u201d Andrew Little said. Clinical experts at the Ministry of Health and PHARMAC are currently updating the eligibility criteria for a free flu vaccination with a focus on reducing the age of eligibility for at-risk populations, and potentially including a wider range of young people. Currently flu vaccinations are free for pregnant women, over 65s, and people who have certain medical conditions including those with cancer and diabetes. This campaign will run alongside wider paediatric vaccination campaigns to better protect our vulnerable communities from preventable disease. ENDS",

It\u2019s encouraging all employers, covered by the Vaccinations Order or not, to support their employees to get their booster vaccinations as soon as they are able to. \u201cAfter consultation with the workforces most likely to come into contact with Omicron, workforces covered by the Vaccination Order including border, MIQ and health and disability workers will be required to have their booster by 15 February 2022, or not later than six months after their second dose for those who were only recently vaccinated. \u201cAll other workforces covered by the Vaccination Order including Education, Corrections, Police, Defence, and Fire and Emergency workforces will be required to have their booster vaccination by 1 March 2022. \u201cAnyone aged 18 or older who has had two doses of COVID-19 vaccine at least four months ago is able to get their free booster vaccine. \u202fBooster doses are available at all vaccination centres including walk-ins and drive-throughs, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe single most important thing New Zealanders can do to prepare for Omicron is to get a booster dose as soon as they are eligible. \u202fI want to thank all New Zealanders who have already arranged and received their boosters. \u201dNotes for editors:On 21 December 2021, Cabinet announced a suite of precautionary measures to keep Omicron out of the community for as long as possible, including making it a requirement for eligible border and health workers to get a booster vaccination. International evidence shows that booster doses provide good protection against Omicron, and by achieving high levels of booster protection we will be able to reduce the spread and severity of Omicron when it arrives. Affected workers who are not eligible for a booster vaccination by the set dates should receive a booster vaccination no later than 6 months (183 days) after the completion of their primary course. However, they are eligible for a vaccine booster shot from four months after the completion of their primary vaccine course and the Ministry recommends they take the earlier dose, rather than wait the full six months. People are not eligible for a booster vaccination if they are under 18 years of age. People covered by the Vaccinations Order who are under 18 years, can continue to work and they should not get their booster until they reach 18 years old.

More than 89 per cent of eligible New Zealanders are now fully vaccinated, which demonstrates the massive effort already undertaken by individuals and workplaces across the country. \u201cBusinesses have been calling for clear rules in law to help guide decisions on vaccine requirements for workers. We have delivered on that, with a new, simplified tool to assess when it is reasonable to require vaccination for work, which will be particularly helpful to small businesses. \u201cThe assessment tool builds on guidance already provided by WorkSafe. It specifies four key factors, covering public health considerations. At leastthree of the factors must be met before it is reasonable to require vaccination for particular work, \u201d Michael Wood said. The vaccination assessment tool includes the following four factors: the work environment, whether the worker can maintain one metre physical distancing, the length of time the worker is in close proximity to another person, and whether the worker provides services to people who are vulnerable to COVID-19. \u201cI\u2019m aware that many businesses have already conducted their own health and safety risk assessments to determine whether vaccination is required. This new process won\u2019t override those assessments, and businesses can choose which assessment process to follow. \u201cAs per normal health and safety processes, any decisions about workplace vaccination requirements must be made in consultation with workers and their representatives, like unions. \u201cThe clarity and detail in the tool provides confidence to businesses and workers that the right process is being followed, \u201d Michael Wood said.",

Rollout to start from 17 January prior to school returning in 2022. Cabinet confirms use of traffic light system to manage outbreak and in the event of Omicron outbreaks areas will move into the red traffic light settingCabinet has agreed a suite of precautionary measures to keep Omicron out of the community for as long as possible, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today. \u201cAll of the evidence so far points to Omicron being the most transmissible COVID-19 variant yet and public health advice says that soon, every case that comes into MIQ will be Omicron, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cBut experts still don\u2019t know how severe it is. So while it\u2019s sweeping the globe at a bewildering speed and appears to be the dominant variant, how sick it makes people and the impact it has on health systems is not yet fully understood. \u201cWith over 70 countries around the world reporting Omicron cases and its high\u00a0 transmissibility, our plan is to get as prepared as we can by speeding up boosters and strengthening our border to keep Omicron out of the community for as long as possible. \u201cWe start our response to Omicron with a number of advantages on our side. We have over 90 per cent and rising of the population fully vaccinated, we still have our border protections and MIQ in place, school has finished for the year and we are heading into summer when we are outdoors more. \u201cBut we need to do more. Parts of the world are going back into lockdown and experiencing major disruption, and with these extra steps we aim to keep Omicron at bay to ensure New Zealanders get the break they deserve and businesses can remain open. Boosters\u201cThe first step in our plan is accelerating the booster rollout, following advice from the Director-General. \u201cThe advice from the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group is that shortening the period between the second and booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine is an appropriate and pragmatic step and is in line with what other countries are doing. \u201cData is emerging that a booster dose with Pfizer provides better protection than two-dose course against the Omicron variant. \u201cWhile two doses is likely to hold a good degree of protection against severe disease from Omicron, a third dose is likely to offer great protection against transmission of COVID-19 and reducing the chance of more serious infections. \u201cThe shorter timeframe will start in January and we\u2019ll continue to follow health advice if it recommends the gap in doses can and should reduce further. \u201cOver 82 per cent of vaccinated New Zealanders will be eligible for a booster by the end of February 2022. \u201cWe know that the most likely place for Omicron to enter the community is at the border, so we want all border and eligible health workers to have the extra protection the booster vaccine provides to protect them and their families. The border continues to be our first line of defence. \u201cMore than half of border workers eligible for a booster at 6 months have already had it \u2013 which is a great response \u2013 but we need to get the numbers up quickly. \u201cCabinet has therefore agreed in principle that where workers are required to be vaccinated, that this mandate will also extend to boosters. \u201cInitially this will be for those workers most likely to come into contact with Omicron -- border and health workers -- who will be required to have their booster by the end of January, or not later six months after their second dose for those who were only recently vaccinated, and then to all others who are under a vaccination mandate by the 1st of March. Strengthening MIQ\u201cWe are fortunate we still have MIQ in place. Without it, Omicron would already be in the community and Christmas plans would be under threat. \u201cTo further strengthen the border, we\u2019re shortening the pre-departure test requirement from 72 hours to 48 hours before travel in order to assist in picking up more people with the virus before they get on a plane. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve sought advice on implementing a requirement for all non-New Zealand citizens entering to New Zealand to have had a booster dose before flying. \u201cWe are also making a temporary change to MIQ that increases the length of stay from 7 to 10 days. Currently returnees do their final 3 days of isolation at home. Bringing those final three days back into MIQ reduces the risk of the virus entering the community. Changes to re-opening plan\u201cTo slow the rapid spread we have seen overseas, we are pushing out the start of non-MIQ travel until the end of February 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this is disappointing and will upset many holiday plans, but it\u2019s important to set these changes out clearly today so they can have time to consider those plans. \u201cCOVID-19 keeps throwing new curve balls and we have to respond in a way that continues to protect lives and livelihoods without putting in place restrictions and lockdowns unless absolutely necessary. \u201cWaiting till the end of February will increase New Zealand\u2019s overall protection and slow Omicron\u2019s eventual spread. Use of traffic light system to manage outbreaks\u201cWith these changes, we\u2019re buying New Zealand as much time as we can, as scientists here and overseas race to get a clearer picture of Omicron. \u201cIn moving to the traffic light system, we signalled that we would be adjusting to more of a reactive stance when it came to protective measures and would apply them when case numbers grew and the health system came under pressure. \u201cOmicron has changed that. When it does arrive, we expect that it will spread fast, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in other places. To slow that spread, we may use the red traffic light settings earlier on. That will give us the best chance to avoid returning to more restrictive alert level settings. \u201cIt is not our intention to move to lockdowns unless absolutely necessary in the event of a widespread outbreak where our health system comes under considerable strain \u2013 and even then the strong preference is for the lockdown to be highly targeted. Chris Hipkins said faced with alternative courses of action, and looking at overseas jurisdictions, Cabinet is strongly of the view that this plan is the best approach for New Zealand. \u201cBy the end of February when we revisit the phased border re-opening, around 3 million more Kiwis will be eligible for the booster shots and the rollout to 5-11 year-olds will be well underway. \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

This work begins with the Cook Islands\u2019 May rollout, which is expected to take 12 weeks to complete, with Niue and Tokelau to follow. \u201d Aupito William Siosaid. The delivery of vaccines to the Realm countries won\u2019t impact the planned New Zealand domestic rollout. Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu have started their vaccine rollouts with doses received from the global COVAX Facility. Each will also be able to receive enough additional doses from New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s own portfolio to fully cover their population, as well as any further support they might need for their vaccine rollout. In addition, Fiji has taken up the offer of AstraZeneca doses for 250,000 people donated by New\u00a0Zealand, subject to Medsafe approval. \u201cNew Zealand is following up its commitment to equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines by donating enough for 800,000 people through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. These doses will go to developing countries, with a focus on the Pacific. \u201cIn total, this means New\u00a0Zealand will be providing protection against COVID-19 to at least 1.2 million people in the Pacific over the coming year, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. New Zealand is also partnering with Australia and UNICEF to procure further vaccines for the Pacific and providing other targeted support where necessary. \u201cTo support Papua New Guinea with its COVID-19 outbreak, New\u00a0Zealand is providing $4 million to help fund its vaccine rollout, medical equipment for a COVID-19 field hospital in Port Moresby and logistical air support to get health staff, PPE and vaccines to remote areas of PNG, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. Nanaia Mahuta also announced New Zealand is providing further support to assist economic recovery in the Pacific. \u201cNew\u00a0Zealand\u2019s further economic support to Pacific countries will help them respond to the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and move towards long-term economic resilience, the Ministers said. To this end, $120 million in Official Development Assistance has been reprioritised to support Pacific economies in 2021. \u201cThe economic disruption affecting many countries in the Pacific, particularly those that have tourism-focused economies, is unprecedented. This funding will be used by our Pacific neighbours to help households get through this crisis, and support businesses to manage the uncertainty of closed borders, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. ENDS",

        "content": "Latest research shows more New Zealanders in major demographic groups will get a COVID-19 vaccine, as the number of doses administered reaches half a million, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today. \u201cMinistry of Health research from April shows 77 per cent of New Zealanders aged 16 years and over say they are likely to get a vaccine or have already received a vaccine. This compares to 69 per cent in March, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe results show thenumber of people who say they are unlikely to get vaccinated dropped to 12 per cent, down from 20 per cent in March and 24 percent in December 2020. Of the 12 per cent unlikely, there remains a smaller group of people who are opposed, at 7.8 per cent. \u201dLatest acceptance rates:Overall \u2013 77 per cent, up from 69 per cent, or 3,147,200 out of 4,082,500 New Zealanders 16 and over7 per cent of these people have had one or two dosesMaori \u2013 71 per cent, up from 64 percent in MarchPasifika \u2013 79 per cent, up from 59 percent in MarchOver 65s are the most likely to get vaccinated\u201cThis is really encouraging. Major information campaigns, solid progress in the vaccine rollout and strong role models in each community are making a real difference. \u201cGiven the rollout has been underway for three months, it is fantastic to already see a steady decline in those who say they won\u2019t get a vaccine, including in those communities considered high-risk. \u201cWe do know it\u2019s important to understand why people might not be ready to commit to getting the vaccine just yet. \u201cThis research indicates that 15 per cent are still unsure whether they have to pay for the vaccine, which is why we keep repeating that it\u2019s free. \u201cThose who identify as disabled are more likely on average to be unsure whether they\u2019ll get vaccinated and there remains a number of people who want to know more about the safety of the vaccine, so we\u2019ve still got work to do. \u201cBut it\u2019s pleasing that the number of people with concerns about the vaccine approval process has nearly halved to 36 per cent, down from 60 per cent in December. \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s medicine approval regime for COVID-19 vaccines is one of the most rigorous in the world. This improvement shows that while mis- and dis-information campaigns remain a concern for the Government, people are getting access to good and accurate information. \u201dMore than half a million doses administered\u201cThe vaccination programme is further ahead than where it was projected to be at this stage, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cAs of last night, 505,820 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered, three months after the first person was vaccinated.

Investing in the wellbeing of M\u0101ori will drive both our economic and social recovery from the effects of COVID-19. This year\u2019s M\u0101ori Budget package invests in the right areas to help our economic recovery plan while ensuring we deliver on the promises we made to M\u0101ori in areas like housing, health, education, tamariki, wh\u0101nau, justice reform and te reo me \u014dna tikanga M\u0101ori. The\u00a0total M\u0101ori Budget package is in excess of $1 billion. The Government\u2019s M\u0101ori Ministers; Kelvin Davis, Nanaia Mahuta, Peeni Henare, Willie\u00a0Jackson and Meka Whaitiri have announced a historic investment moment for M\u0101ori. The social and economic effects of COVID-19 were still being felt by many wh\u0101nau across Aotearoa, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cM\u0101ori Ministers have worked hard to respond to some of the most pressing issues our wh\u0101nau are facing while ensuring that our social investment will bring with it economic growth in regions with the greatest need. \u201cThis Budget package builds on the previous investment we have made in economic initiatives like He Poutama Rangatahi, Mana in Mahi, M\u0101ori Cadetships and M\u0101ori apprenticeships, as well as advances we have made in Justice Reform, in the education sector and in protecting te\u00a0reo M\u0101ori, \u201d Associate Minister for M\u0101ori Development Nanaia\u00a0Mahuta said. \u201cBuilding houses and upgrading kura not only provides wh\u0101nau with homes and better education, it creates jobs and stimulates our local economy. \u201cInvesting in M\u0101ori tourism helps bring back jobs and supports our small businesses to ready themselves to reconnect with the world. \u201cAnd our investment in Health, alongside our Vaccine Strategy, means when we do reconnect \u2013 we do so while keeping our people safe, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. Health and HousingAssociate M\u0101ori Housing and M\u0101ori Health Minister Peeni Henare said improving M\u0101ori health and ensuring M\u0101ori had access to warm dry homes, were the core reasons behind the $242.8 million investment into M\u0101ori health and $380 million targeted towards a M\u0101ori Housing package. The funding for M\u0101ori health includes $98.1 million for the establishment of the M\u0101ori Health Authority, $17.8 million to support ofiwi/M\u0101ori partnership boards and $126.8 million for Hauora M\u0101ori programmes run by the M\u0101ori Health Authority including funding for increasing provider capability and a M\u0101ori health innovation fund. Budget 2021 will invest $380 million into M\u0101ori housing across Aotearoa, the funding will deliver approximately:1,000 additional new houses that will be a range of papak\u0101inga housing, affordable rentals, transitional housing, and owner-occupied housingrepairs for 700 M\u0101ori-owned houses improving the quality of homes for wh\u0101nau in most need, led by Te Puni K\u014dkiri$30 million towards building future capability for iwi and M\u0101ori groups to accelerate housing projects and a range of support services. We have also ensured that $350 million of the Housing Acceleration Fund will be targeted to\u00a0investment in infrastructure to support M\u0101ori and iwi providers build homes for wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori. \u201cHealth and Housing have always been our top priority and these funds will help get better health outcomes for our people and enable us to partner with M\u0101ori from across the regions to build a suite of housing solutions for M\u0101ori on the ground. \u201dThe investment in Housing will also create jobs and employment opportunities for many areas that need them in the wake of COVID-19. \u201cThe funding injection will support the new and independent M\u0101ori Health Authority and the\u00a0iwi/M\u0101ori partnership boards, with a significant portion allocated to Hauora M\u0101ori Health programmes run by the M\u0101ori Health Authority including funding for increasing provider capability and a M\u0101ori health innovation fund, \u201d Peeni Henare said. M\u0101ori TourismMinister for M\u0101ori Development Willie Jackson said M\u0101ori tourism faced significant challenges as a result of COVID-19. Last year, the Government invested $12 million in NZ M\u0101ori Tourism, which helped support M\u0101ori businesses to pivot, transition or hibernate in response to COVID-19. Budget 2021 will support three separate kaupapa \u2013 the expansion of the business support services already offered by New Zealand M\u0101ori Tourism, work to position the M\u0101ori Tourism Industry for the future, as well as providing funding for anchor projects like the East Coast cycle track. \u201cNow we are working towards reconnecting with the world, we are helping to kick start our M\u0101ori tourism sector by investing $15 million, as a charge against the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, in their restart to enable them to play a strong role in our economic recovery, \u201d Willie Jackson said. Tamariki and Wh\u0101nauMinister for Children Kelvin Davis announced that Budget 2021 has set aside $23.4 million in\u00a0the wellbeing of tamariki and wh\u0101nau in the greatest need. Oranga Tamariki will be working with partners in 2021 to develop a strategy for the children\u2019s system that responds to the findings of the recent reviews, as well as upcoming reports from the Waitangi Tribunal and the Ministerial Advisory Board. The Strategy is likely to envisage a system where tamariki with the greatest need are safe and supported within their wh\u0101nau by marae, hap\u016b, iwi and their communities at the earliest opportunity, enabled by a system that\u2019s trusted to step in only when needed. Budget 2021 funding will help ensure we develop solutions that take a by M\u0101ori, for M\u0101ori approach to improve the support that M\u0101ori can deliver to tamariki and wh\u0101nau in need. \u201cWe have a lot of work still to do with Oranga Tamariki but this targeted funding will help move the organisation in the right direction by enabling us to devolve more power to the regions and to M\u0101ori, and ensuring tamariki stay with their wh\u0101nau where possible, \u201d Kelvin\u00a0Davis said. Justice ReformM\u0101ori pathways for w\u0101hine in Christchurch women\u2019s prison was just one of a number of justice reform initiatives the five Ministers were announcing in Budget 2021, Kelvin Davis said. \u201cWe are investing more than $10 million into this new co-designed pathway ensuring w\u0101hine are provided a M\u0101ori pathway out of prison. A journey they can share with their wh\u0101nau. \u201cAcross the system, we are investing in M\u0101ori solutions. $70 million is to be invested in Te\u00a0Pae Oranga iwi community panels \u2013 a tikanga M\u0101ori and wh\u0101nau ora based alternative to court for low-level offending. \u201cWe are investing $12 million to prevent family violence and sexual violence by expanding wh\u0101nau-centred facilitation by kaupapa M\u0101ori providers, $13.7 million in Whakaorangia te mana tangata \u2013 which aims to uplift the mana of offenders, victims and their wh\u0101nau, \u201d Kelvin\u00a0Davis said. M\u0101ori EducationOver $150 million will be invested in M\u0101ori education through this year\u2019s Budget. This includes a $20 million package to support M\u0101ori boarding schools, an investment in our future, Meka Whaitiri said. \u201cOur M\u0101ori boarding schools grow the next generation of M\u0101ori leaders, and it is important that we preserve the vital role they play in the education of our rangatahi. \u201dAs well as M\u0101ori boarding schools, Budget 2021 addresses immediate cost pressures facing w\u0101nanga with $32.3 million and also sets aside funds to start to address the inequitable funding of w\u0101nanga. For tamariki and mokopuna funding has also been set aside to improve pay in our k\u014dhanga reo. We are also investing $77 million in property funding to build and expand schools delivering M\u0101ori medium education and investing in M\u0101ori learners\u2019 success by putting more funding into Te Reo Matatini, P\u0101ngarau, and Marautanga. \u201cM\u0101ori education has seen a significant investment boost under this Government, Budget 2021 is a further investment in the education of our tamariki and rangatahi, \u201d Meka Whaitiri said. M\u0101ori Data Sovereignty\u201cA lesson we learnt from our experience with COVID-19 is the need for better data collection, and the necessity for us to partner with M\u0101ori to gather this information that will provide better guidance to iwi and to the Government when making policy decisions in areas that affect our people, \u201d Associate Minister of Statistics Meka Whaitiri said. \u201cWe have secured through Budget 2021, $14.1 million to support our Treaty partners in building their data collection and analysis capability by assisting iwi to collect responses to the 2023 Census in two geographic areas. This initiative also aims to support the existing 2023 Census programme by improving response rates in priority groups. \u201dTe Reo me \u014dna tikanga\u201cSafeguarding te reo M\u0101ori for future generations is a goal this Government is taking seriously, and Budget 2021 enables us to take the next step in achieving these aspirations, \u201d Willie Jackson said. \u201cAn investment of $14.8 million is going to further support the implementation of the M\u0101ori language strategy, helping us to achieve our goal of one million New Zealanders able to speak basic te reo\u00a0M\u0101ori by 2040. \u201cMore equitable funding for M\u0101ori is vital and investing $42 million into M\u0101ori broadcasting to build a sustainable M\u0101ori media sector and investing in programme content, is a step in the right direction. \u201cWe all want to mihi to our fellow M\u0101ori Minister Kiri Allan. Before she took leave she secured $45.7 million operating and $850,000 capital funding for emergency management. An immediate priority will be growing the role iwi M\u0101ori play. \u201cWe are all very proud of the M\u0101ori Budget package for 2021. It strikes the right balance between economic recovery and social investment, all while ensuring we take a \u2018by M\u0101ori, for M\u0101ori\u2019 approach in areas like justice reform, health and education. \u201cWe are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19, and we have still more to do. Budget 2021 shows we are tackling the hard problems while putting the wellbeing of wh\u0101nau at the centre of our solutions, \u201d Willie Jackson said.",

        "content": "Retired and overseas-trained health professionals and the wider health workforce can now join New Zealand\u2019s expanding vaccinator workforce, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said today. The Government has changed Medicines Regulations to allow more health workers to be trained to give vaccinations \u2013 to lend a hand as we move to the next phase of the biggest vaccination campaign in New Zealand\u2019s history. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on retired nurses, people who have trained overseas but are not registered here, and those in the kai\u0101whina workforce \u2013 who work in our health system already in roles such as healthcare assistants \u2013 to join our vaccinator team, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cMore than 12,500 people with a wide range of backgrounds, including many ex health professionals, have already logged their details in the Hands-Up database, which is designed to capture a broad range of skills and backgrounds for different roles. \u201cWe anticipate many of the former health professionals who have entered their details into Hands-Up will be keen to become involved in the vaccination programme. \u201cDHBs have been following up with potential candidates to bring people on board as we scale up the vaccination programme. \u201cOthers urged to join in can enrol through the databasewww.health.govt.nz/HandsUpRegistrations can be completed in English, Te Reo M\u0101ori, Samoan and Tongan. \u201cThe change will also allow us to boost the numbers of M\u0101ori and Pacific vaccinators. It also provides these new vaccinators with enhanced career opportunities in the health sector. \u201cThe Immunisation Advisory Centre has trained more than 8,100 COVID-19 vaccinators from across the health sector since the beginning of the year, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThis influx of health workers will boost both these numbers and the diversity of the workforce. \u201cAll new recruits will receive training through the Immunisation Advisory Centre and will work under the supervision and direction of registered health practitioners. \u201cThey will also be trained in basic emergency techniques, including resuscitation and treatment of anaphylaxis. This is required for anyone administering medicines across the health workforce. \u201cCurrent projections are that we will need 1,600 full-time equivalent vaccinators at the peak of the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. This means we will likely need between 6,000 to 6,500 people vaccinating in part or full time roles, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Gisborne iwi health provider first to complete vaccinator training\u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate 12 kai\u0101whina from T\u016branga Health, an Iwi health provider in Gisborne, who have become the first to complete the face-to-face training to become COVID-19 vaccinators from this new workforce. \u201cThis group of vaccinators are from a broad range of roles and backgrounds and are excited to learn new skills to support the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in protecting wh\u0101nau in T\u016branga-nui-a-Kiwa and surrounding areas. They are a welcome addition to T\u016branga Health\u2019s 14 vaccinators. \u201dProfiles of two new vaccinators:Henry Lamont, who has worked as a wh\u0101nau ora kai\u0101whina at T\u016branga Health for the past two and a half years, said it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to take up the opportunity to train as a COVID-19 vaccinator. \u201cIt means I can help to help protect wh\u0101nau in my community. And me being a male M\u0101ori, it gives that option for wh\u0101nau to choose when they get vaccinated. \u201dAs coach for the local junior rep team in touch rugby and well-known in sporting circles, he hoped to leverage off his community links to encourage people to get vaccinated. Dallas Poi, an experienced kai\u0101whina and community manager for T\u016branga Health, said she was excited to get the opportunity to contribute to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in her community. \u201cMy whakapapa is to Rongowhakaata and Ng\u0101ti Porou so I\u2019ll be a familiar face as a vaccinator for wh\u0101nau. The training raises the competency level of kai\u0101whina and extends our scope of practice, which is also important in our role to promote health. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to giving actual injections to wh\u0101nau and we\u2019re really stoked to be the first to complete the face-to-face part of the training. \u201d",

This funding will help their Governments to continue supporting the needs of their most vulnerable communities. \u201cIt will also contribute to sustaining livelihoods through measures such as social support payments, infrastructure stimulus, and tourism business support, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. This economic package of $100 million brings COVID-19 budget support provided to the Cook Islands and Fiji during the global pandemic to a combined total of $215 million. In addition to health and vaccine support, New Zealand is also supporting other initiatives that contribute to economic resilience. These include improved access to advice and finance for small-medium businesses in the Cook Islands and supporting Fiji to implement reforms to improve the business and investment climate. \u201cWe know that we all need to play our part in the global effort to respond and recover from COVID-19, especially with our close Pacific neighbours. By working together we are ensuring a stronger, more resilient region that sees benefits for everyone, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. New Zealand is providing $60 million to the Cook Islands, and $40 million to Fiji.",

        "content": "Hon Damien O'Connor MP, New Zealand Minister for Trade and Export Growth, and Hon Dan Tehan MP, Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, met virtually on Monday 20 September to advance trans-Tasman cooperation under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER). CER is one of the most comprehensive trade agreements in the world and underpins the integration of the New Zealand and Australian economies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these open economic settings have benefitted exporters and businesses in both countries, contributing to the economic resilience of New Zealand and Australia. Ministers reiterated the importance of the Single Economic Market agenda between Australia and New Zealand to support shared prosperity for our economies, our businesses, and our communities. As part of this agenda, Ministers discussed recent cooperation on supply chains and progress on a Secure Trade Lane that would maximise efficiencies in low-risk goods trade. Ministers also acknowledged the ongoing work in digital trade and e-commerce, science and innovation, circular economy, and Indigenous business collaboration. Reflecting the importance of free movement of people between Australia and New\u00a0Zealand, Ministers highlighted their desire to see further opportunities for travel between Australia and New\u00a0Zealand as soon as health conditions allow. They reiterated the commitment made by the New Zealand and Australian Prime\u00a0Ministers\u2019 to work together on re-opening to our Pacific neighbours when it is safe to do so and on systems that would enable a safe reopening to other parts of the world. Ministers reinforced both countries\u2019 commitment to the multilateral rules-based trading system which provides the predictability and stability necessary to ensure that trade can take place efficiently and with the least friction possible. As demonstrated by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits this system delivers for our countries are more important than ever. Ministers reiterated their concernover the use of coercive economic practices, and notedthe threat these practices pose to the integrity of the multilateral rules-based trading system. Ministers resolved to work together to support a strong outcome at the WTO\u2019s 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) that promotes a free, fair, predictable, non-discriminatory, transparent, and open trade and investment environment. New\u00a0Zealand and Australia will continue to work together, including in the Cairns Group, to advocate foragreementat MC12on parametersto cap and reduce trade and production distorting agriculture domestic support by at least half by 2030 and to conclude fisheries subsidies negotiations as soon as possible before the Ministerial. Australia and New Zealand are also working together to deliver a strong outcome on trade and health, including a temporary waiver of certain intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines and other WTO trade and health initiatives in response to the pandemic. New\u00a0Zealand and Australia support work to improve the WTO\u2019s negotiating, monitoring and dispute settlement functions, and strongly support a binding, two tier operational multilateral dispute settlement system. Ministers welcomed progress across the Joint Statement Initiatives launched in Buenos Aires with a view to updating the WTO rule book to be more inclusive and reflect contemporary issues in international trade. \u00a0 They looked forward to delivering new rules on services domestic regulation at MC12 and substantial progress in the e-commerce negotiations. Ministers welcomed the role Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is playing to uphold the essential role of trade in tackling the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and enabling a strong economic recovery in the region. Ministers reflected on the highly successful Informal Leaders\u2019 Meeting chaired by Prime\u00a0Minister Jacinda Ardern in July, which demonstrated the value of APEC as a vehicle for responding to the health and economic crisis. Ministers committed to working together and with APEC members to implement the commitments in the APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade statement, agreed in June 2021, particularly to reduce costs related to vaccines and related goods. Ministers highlighted the role APEC can play in strengthening Indigenous businesses\u2019 access to global markets. Ministers welcomed the good progress being made by the membership, to agree an ambitious plan by the end of the year, for APEC\u2019s contribution to making the region open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful by 2040. Ministers highlighted the importance of regional trade agreements in providing economic architecture that supports an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. They highlighted the importance of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in setting a high standard of rules for trade in the region, and looked forward to Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership signatories completing their ratification processes so that it can enter into force.

        "content": "Onsite learning at schools in Level 3 regions will start from next week for senior secondary school students to prepare for end of year exams, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said today. \u201cSecondary schools in these regions will start onsite learning for years 11 to 13 on Tuesday 26 October, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThis is a complex issue requiring difficult trade-offs between improving education and increasing potential health risks for children and young people. \u201cLearners in this age group are able to be vaccinated and are required to wear masks, and staff and volunteers working on site will need a negative test before attending. \u201cGovernment agencies have also continued to refine public health measures for school and early learning services. \u201cChildren, young people and staff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should stay at home unless fully vaccinated, face coverings are mandatory for staff and learners in years 9 to 13, and records must be kept for contact tracing purposes. Face coverings on school transport will also be mandatory. \u201cAnd staff and volunteers in all regions need to receive their first vaccine by 15 November. \u201cFor years 1 to 10 the picture is more complex. I\u2019m not completely ruling out these students in level 3 regions being able to return before the end of the year but if they do, we\u2019ll need to be satisfied there are sufficient processes in place to minimise any risk. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to acknowledge that any settings where there are groups of children under 12, it\u2019s higher risk \u2013 as they are not yet able to be vaccinated. \u201cBut there are mitigations that can be put in place to keep the risk as low as possible. We can consider rostered attendance to reduce the number of students on site at any given time. The warmer summer months also provide more opportunities for learning outdoors where the risk of COVID-19 spreading is lower. \u201cCabinet will consider the latest health advice and the options on Tuesday. \u201dNotes to editorsThere will no longer be bubbles of up to 10 students required when all senior students return on-site, including for those students already on-site in years 1 - 10. Wherever practicable a 1 metre distance should be kept from all others on-site, particularly between staff, and a two metre distance from people you don\u2019t know. Requirements for secondary schools:staff and children who are unwell must stay at home, and get tested for COVID-19children at higher risk of severe illness remain home, where possiblestaff who are not fully vaccinated and at higher risk of severe illness must remain homemandatory mask wearing for staff and students in years 9 - 13only essential visitors will be permitted onsite, and all visitors on-site will need to wear a face coveringgood hand hygiene and cough and sneeze etiquetteclassrooms to be well ventilatedhigh touch surfaces will be cleaned and disinfected each dayphysical distancing will be adhered to wherever practicable, particularly between adultsphysical distancing of two metres will be in place from people you don\u2019t knowQR code posters for the COVID app will be displayeda contact tracing register in place for everyone coming onsite including students and staff, through the attendance register, timetable and visitor register.face coverings will be required on school transport for people aged 12 and overtime outdoors for students and staff will be maximised, including breaks, lunchtime, before and after school (unless the weather does not allow), and rooms will be aired during breaksexercising and singing will take place outdoorsgroups meeting indoors, including assemblies or staff meetings, will be avoided.",

        "title": "Therapeutic Products Bill introduced",
        "content": "Legislation to modernise the way medicines, medical devices and natural health products are regulated has been introduced in Parliament today. The Therapeutic Products Bill replaces the Medicines Act 1981 and Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985 with a comprehensive regulatory regime that is fit for the future. Health Minister Andrew Little said the Bill will give New Zealanders peace-of-mind about the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicines, medical devices (such as COVID-19 test kits) and natural health products they are using. \u201cQuality medicines and medical devices are essential for a well-functioning health system, and consumers need to know the natural health products they\u2019re buying off the shelf are safe, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cThe Therapeutic Products Bill is a flexible regulatory framework for how therapeutic products are manufactured, prescribed, imported, advertised, supplied and exported, and makes the regulation of clinical trials more robust. \u201cIt enables New Zealand to take advantage of advances in medicine, such as cell and tissue therapies, emerging gene therapies, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning software. Having risk-proportionate approval systems will improve access to necessary and life-saving medicines, such as vaccines in a pandemic. \u201cConsumer safety sits at the heart of the Bill, so the community will be better protected from goods and gadgets that make unfounded or misleading therapeutic claims. \u201cHaving a modern set of laws and regulations that line up with international practices will also help our medicines and natural health products industries to export to the world. \u201cThe Therapeutic Products Bill has been more than a decade in the making and, alongside the Pae Ora (Health Futures) Act, will contribute to building a health system New Zealanders expect and deserve, \u201d Andrew Little said. ADDITIONAL NOTESDetailed considerationThe Therapeutic Products Bill is the result of more than a decade of policy work. It incorporates what has been learned from consultation on the Natural Health and Supplementary Products Bill that was introduced in 2011 before being discontinued, as well as the regulation of therapeutic products policy proposals released in April 2016. The Bill is expected to have its first reading in Parliament before Christmas and will be referred to the Health Select Committee for detailed examination including public and industry submissions. Natural health productsThe Therapeutic Products Bill will regulate natural health products, but in a separate category from medicines and medical devices. Natural health products are intended to support, promote or maintain health in some way, so are in the category of \u2018therapeutic products\u2019. However the rules applying to natural health products will reflect the fact that they are generally lower risk than medicines and medical devices. The Bill will ensure market standards for the quality of products (such as Vitamin C tablets) in the places they are already supplied, such as supermarkets. New regulatorThe Bill establishes a new regulator within Manat\u016b Hauora \u2013 Ministry of Health, headed by an independent statutory officer, with a wider remit than the medicines regulator Medsafe. The new regulator will be responsible for ensuring the safety, quality and efficacy of regulated products across their lifecycle. It will design and implement proportionate, risk-based market authorisation pathways to support the timely availability of therapeutic products. Its functions will include, in addition to market authorisation, licensing controlled activities, post-market surveillance, compliance and enforcement. Additional resources will be made available to setup the new regulatory regime while ensuring the day-to-day work of Medsafe continues efficiently. The new regulator have the same ability as Medsafe to recover costs through fees, charges and levies, which will be set after consultation with the relevant sectors, professions and individuals it regulates. The Bill also includes a range of modern enforcement tools allowing for a graduated and proportionate response to breaches, including tiered criminal offences, strict liability offences, improved infringement notices and a civil pecuniary penalty regime.",

        "content": "All New Zealanders aged 30 and over will be able to access the new COVID bivalent booster from April as part of the Government\u2019s plan to keep Kiwis safe and take pressure off our health system, says Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall. The new bivalent vaccine will replace the existing Pfizer booster and is consideredlikely to be moreeffective against Omicron subvariants. \u00a0Bivalent vaccines work by combiningtwo strains of a virus, which prompts the body to create antibodies against both strains, providing a greater level of protection. \u201cFrom 1 April, anyone 30+ will be eligible to receive the bivalent vaccine, as long as it\u2019s been at least 6 months since their last COVID-19 booster or positive COVID-19 test, \u201d Dr Verrall said. \u201cPeople at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 will also be able to receive an additional booster, regardless of how many doses they\u2019ve previously had. \u201cAs well as broadening the criteria from April, from 1 March anyone currently eligible for a COVID-19 booster will be able to get the new bivalent vaccine. \u201cWe know vaccination is the best protection against the virus, and these actions will provide added protection to a larger number of adult New Zealanders. Latest reporting from the Ministry of Health indicated 8,220 cases over the previous week so the virus is definitely still circulating out there. \u201cWe\u2019re also planning for older New Zealanders and those most at risk of getting sick to get a flu jab at the same time as their COVID-19 booster. This will be part of a \u2018one and done\u2019 approach to help people stay well this winter. \u201cBecause it may be a while since your previous boosters, now is a good time to check your records onwww. BookMyVaccine.nz. Vaccination against COVID-19 remains free. \u201cGetting boosted is important for your health and keeping out of hospital this winter, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. ENDSEditors NotesIn making this decision, the Government accepted advice from the Ministry of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group (CV-TAG) and other experts. Those\u00a0currently eligible for the COVID-19 booster are encouraged to make a booking by visitingwww. BookMyVaccine.nzor calling the COVID-19 Vaccination Healthline on 0800 28 29 26 (8am to 8pm, 7 days a week). People who will become eligible for an additional booster from 1 April will be able to make a booking later in March. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIACurrent eligibilityFirst boostersIf you're aged 18 or over, and you completed your primary vaccination course* at least 3 months ago, you're eligible for a\u202fPfizer\u202fbooster.

If you're aged 16 or 17, and you completed your primary vaccination course* at least 6 months ago, you're eligible for a booster. Only Pfizer is approved for this age group. Second boostersA second booster is recommended for those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 \u2013 a minimum of 6 months after a first booster. People recommended to receive a second booster as a priority:people aged 65 years and overM\u0101ori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and overresidents of aged care and disability care facilitiesseverely immunocompromised people who received a three-dose primary course and a fourth dose as a first booster (noting this would be a fifth dose for these people)Other people recommended to receive a second booster as a prioritypeople aged 16 years and over who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe breakthrough COVID-19 illness andpeople aged 16 years and over who live with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities.

        "title": "COVID_19 vaccine slated for possible approval next week",
        "content": "The green light for New Zealand\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccine could be granted in just over a week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today. \u201cWe\u2019re making swift progress towards vaccinating New Zealanders against the virus, but we\u2019re also absolutely committed to ensuring the vaccines are safe and effective, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cMedicines regulator Medsafe will seek advice and recommendations from the Medicines Assessment Advisory Committee (MAAC) next Tuesday, about the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. \u201cThe Ministerial expert advisory committee will review Medsafe\u2019s benefit-risk assessment of the pharmaceutical company\u2019s data and, depending on feedback, Medsafe may be able to grant provisional approval as soon as the following day. \u201cMedsafe\u2019s process not only ensures New Zealanders can feel confident in the vaccines we receive, it\u2019s also been timely and means we will be ready to receive and administer vaccines as soon as Pfizer is in a position to send them. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known a safe and effective vaccine is a vital part of our COVID-19 response for our long-term control of the virus. 2021 is Year of the Vaccine, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said COVID-19 vaccines will play a critical role in protecting New Zealanders\u2019 health and wellbeing and, over time, will be a big step back to normality. \u201cOur first focus will be vaccinating our border and managed isolation and quarantine workforce and their close contacts. Once the vaccine arrives in New Zealand, we expect to be able to complete vaccinating this group within two to three weeks. \u201cThese brave people have been protecting our country from this global pandemic during the past year and protecting them and those who share their households is a priority for us. \u201cThat will be the start of New Zealand\u2019s largest ever vaccination campaign. And that will take some time and the most important thing is when we finish not when we start. \u00a0 However we do intend to get our front line staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Doing so will add another layer to our border defences. We hope to start vaccinating the wider population mid-year. \u201cIf granted, the provisional approval will mean that Medsafe has sufficient information and assurance of both safety and effectiveness for it to allow vaccination to start \u2013 though there will be continued monitoring of the vaccine here and overseas. \u201cHowever, if Medsafe decides next week that some additional assurances are required before it grants approval, I accept their decision and am satisfied that it\u2019s the right decision on behalf of all of us. \u201cIt\u2019s vital for New Zealanders to know that Medsafe is undertaking robust assessments of this vaccine and others so that we can be confident they\u2019re safe and effective. It streamlined its approval processes for faster access, but it hasn\u2019t cut any corners along the way. \u201cSafety is paramount and we want to be assured of this and also allow all New Zealanders the same opportunity of protection as other countries, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Q and AHow long will theMedicines Assessment Advisory Committeetake to make their recommendations?We expect they will make their recommendations and give their advice to Medsafe, which has delegated authority from the Minister, on 2 February. Who is on theMedicines Assessment Advisory Committee?It is an 11-member committee of people from around New Zealand with a broad range of skills, such as biostatistics, infectious diseases, geriatrics, paediatrics, consumer interests, pharmaceutical chemistry and manufacturing, clinical pharmacology, toxicology, clinical genetics, rheumatology and psychiatry. Their identities aren\u2019t public to protect them from external pressure in giving independent, free and frank advice about medicine approvals. Where will the 2 February meeting take place?The members are from around New Zealand so will meet virtually, as is usual practice. Key Medsafe members will also attend. What happens next after MAAC gives their recommendations and advice on 2 February?Medsafe will consider its feedback and may decide to grant provisional consent, which will likely include conditions that require the pharmaceutical company to provide data and information within an agreed timeframe. This includes additional clinical trial and manufacturing data as it becomes available. If the company agrees to any required conditions, Medsafe will formally gazette the decision to approve the vaccine\u2019s provisional consent for use in New Zealand. That could happen as quickly as the day after the MAAC meeting. When will the vaccines arrive in New Zealand?We expect the first vaccines will arrive in New Zealand by the end of the first quarter but we are making sure everything is in place in case of an earlier arrival. We have broadly similar timing expectations as Australia. We acknowledge that there is international pressures for Pfizer and BioNTech to prioritise countries that have serious community transmission of COVID-19. As we have seen, timelines are changing often. How has Medsafe streamlined its approval process?We have prioritised the COVID-19 vaccines and allocated assessors for each vaccine candidate. We have close communication with the pharmaceutical companies about the timelines for getting their data and we\u2019ve been accepting rolling submissions of data. We received the first set of data from Pfizer last November. Last week, we received a large amount of data from Pfizer. After assessing it, we\u2019ve asked them some questions, for which we\u2019ve requested a response in a week. Normally we\u2019d give companies four months to respond. What happens if we choose not to use but Australia does?New Zealand, like Australia, has to make a decision to use that will best support our Immunisation Programme from the portfolio of vaccines that have been purchased. Why are you vaccinating border workers first?We\u2019ve always known that our greatest risk of COVID-19 entering New Zealand is at our border because the virus is rampant in many countries overseas, which is why we\u2019ve put such tight measures in place at our border. Protecting people working at the border and those at greatest risk of COVID-19 protects our entire population. Our sequencing of who we vaccinate first only changes if our situation changes, such as if we have widespread community transmission. How will we safeguard M\u0101ori?Under the no/low transmission scenario, the best protection for everyone in New Zealand is to protect those who are most at risk of infection and their household contacts. We are also reviewing the evidence for additional risk faced by M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples in relation to infection and transmission, more serious illness and death, and the cultural, social and economic impacts. We will engage with key stakeholders and consider this alongside implementation options to determine the best approach. Where will the first vaccinations of the general public be done?Initial delivery settings are likely to be workplace and some community locations. We are engaging with DHBs on their local plans for the initial scenarios, including the providers they are likely to engage. As more vaccines become available, we will add new settings as we scale through the year. How much will all the doses of vaccinations cost?Cabinet has set aside just under $NZ 1 billion ($NZ 983.7 million) from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to secure access to COVID-19 vaccines. This will be New Zealand\u2019s largest immunisation roll out ever. We have never before attempted an immunisation programme of this scale, cost or complexity. We\u2019re aiming to vaccinate as many New Zealanders as possible \u2013 so that\u2019s potentially 5 million people. Do you have enough vaccinators trained for the rollout?We\u2019re planning for an extra 2,000-3,000 full time (or equivalent) vaccinators who will be trained and available when needed throughout New Zealand. An initial call for expressions of interest has gone out via the COVID-19 surge workforce webpage, and we are working with partners across the health and disability system (including regulatory authorities for the relevant healthcare professions and occupational health providers) to engage additional vaccinator capacity across New Zealand. So far more than 1,100 people have registered their interest in being involved. In addition, more than 1,200 people have been trained as provisional vaccinators, ready to complete the COVID-19 vaccine training once available. The Ministry of Health has contracted the Immunisation Advisory Centre to provide training on COVID-19 vaccines. This training is expected to begin in February \u2014 initially for those vaccinators who will deliver the Pfizer vaccine and then for nurses, doctors and pharmacists. This training will be available online and face to face across the country.",

        "content": "New Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 vaccinator workforce continues to expand with more than 10,000 people having now completed Pfizer vaccine training, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news that 10,497 vaccinators have now worked through the vaccinator training course, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWith 5114 of those people having been active in the vaccinator workforce since February, the increasing size and scope of the rollout is clearly benefitting from their expertise. \u201cA huge amount of work has gone on to have the vaccinator workforce ready to peak at the right time - the Ministry of Health predicts we\u2019ll need at least 1,600 full-time equivalent vaccinators during the periods of highest demand in September and October. \u201cHowever, because of the part-time nature of many roles, during this key period we\u2019ll actually need more than 6,500 people active on the vaccine roster at any one time. \u201cToday\u2019s tally means we\u2019re on track to meet that goal. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been seeing a strong response to our programme targeting kai\u0101whinavaccinators \u2013 people already working in our health system in roles such as healthcare assistants. When trained, thekai\u0101whina workstreamfeeds into the broader group. \u201cMore than 250 people have signed up to be part of it, and 70 kai\u0101whina COVID-19 trained vaccinators have already moved through the programme to be out in the field, with more in training. \u201cKai\u0101whina have embraced the opportunity to learn how to vaccinate so they can help protect their communities. \u201cThis programme isalso a boost for the number of M\u0101ori and Pacific vaccinators, helping make sure everyone can feel comfortable when they access their shots. \u201cThis programme will continue to grow. \u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s important because although more than half of our COVID-19 vaccinators were already experienced vaccinators, including registered nurses, medical practitioners and pharmacists, we recognised we needed to ensure a diverse and growing workforce. \u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed new pathways to broaden professions and backgrounds. \u00a0\u00a0 That approach has increased the size of the vaccinator pool, and broadened its diversity. \u201cLast year, the Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) started provisional vaccinator training, which widened the range of health professionals who could join our COVID-19 vaccinator workforce. \u201cMany have taken up this opportunity, with more than a third of those who\u2019ve completed the Pfizer vaccination training completing the provisional vaccinator course first. \u201cThis opened up opportunities for final year student nurses, midwives, pharmacists and paramedics, plus fourth-year onwards medical students to become COVID-19 vaccinators. \u201cOther health professionals have also been able to train, including dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians. \u201cHaving heard just a few of the stories motivating our recruits, I\u2019m offering up a huge thanks to everyone. \u201cI would particularly acknowledge the commitment of people like Renee Muru-Barnard and the team of kai\u0101whina in South Auckland. \u00a0 They\u2019re some of the\u00a0 Kiwis who\u2019ve stepped up to join our largest ever vaccination programme, and to support their communities\u2019 health and wellbeing. \u201cSo many people from a wide spectrum of professions and walks of life are taking up the baton to help protect their fellow New Zealanders. \u201cI want to applaud their commitment, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Profile:\u00a0 Renee Muru-Barnard, COVID-19 vaccination manager - Turuki HealthcareRenee\u2019s professional background is with Turuki Healthcare, South Auckland\u201cSouth Auckland is a beautiful place to work in, and I think to have a range of vaccinators there \u2013 people who come from all walks of life, who are of all ethnicities \u2013 they are able to respond better to the cultural needs of whanau, \u201d says Renee about the team she works with. \u201cI think that\u2019s really important. \u00a0 I\u2019m from a little place in the Hokianga and when Spanish flu came through, it literally wiped out ourhap\u016b. \u201cAnd when I think about COVID and the response we need in little towns like that, I thought that if I could jump out and go and help the vaccine effort, then that\u2019s what I wanted to be able to do. \u201d",

The additional doses will arrive in Auckland on Friday morning to help meet the current surge in demand for vaccination. \u201cIt\u2019s been heartening to see so many New Zealanders getting vaccinated recently and the additional doses that we have purchased from Spain will help us provide additional capacity and walk-in sites through September, \u201dJacinda Ardern said. \u201cWe\u2019re vaccinating well ahead of plan and these additional vaccines will ensure we can continue to ramp up our vaccination programme. \u201cThe Spanish shipment is in addition to New Zealand\u2019s regular weekly delivery from Pfizer which is also expected this weekend. \u201cWe expect to receive a total of 1.8 million doses from Pfizer throughout the month of September, in addition to the doses purchased from Spain. This means we don\u2019t have any plans to slow down the rollout. \u201cThis is the result of excellent collaboration between officials from New Zealand, Spain, the European Commission and Pfizer to secure this agreement. I wish to say thank you to those involved especially President Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain. \u201cWe are deeply grateful to Spain for their cooperation and agreement to sell these doses to New Zealand. This reaffirms the strong links between our countries and is in the spirit of the global values shared by New Zealand and Spain. \u201cWe also wish to extend our appreciation to the European Commission, for coordinating this purchase and to Belgium for their important role in producing the vaccines that New Zealand is the recipient of. \u201cWe expect to make a further announcement about an agreement to buy additional Pfizer vaccines from a second country next week, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

When the pandemic hit, scientists either volunteered time to support the Covid-19 response, or received ad hoc grants for small pieces of research. To address this, we are investing $36 million over three years in a new programme of research to sustain the contribution of cutting-edge science to the response. \u201cThe focus will be on major research questions relating to Covid-19, which are common to all infectious diseases. The first priority area is improving prevention and control, including through better understanding of disease transmission, and further vaccine research. The second is in improving our management of infectious diseases, for instance through diagnostics, surveillance and therapeutics. \u201cReducing the impact of infectious diseases on M\u0101ori and Pacific people, and promoting the development of our next generation of pandemic scientists, are key drivers of this work. \u201cThis important investment will enable us to sustain the valuable contribution scientists make to the Covid-19 response, improve capability and prepare for future pandemics. It will generate practical collaborations between scientists, the health system, and the pandemic response, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will run an investment process, and will open up for proposals from next month for the platform host.

        "content": "New guidance to support businesses and organisations through the upcoming changes to vaccination requirements has been released today. The new guidance has been published onwww.worksafe.govt.nzandwww.employment.govt.nzand helps employers update their health and safety risk assessments, reflecting the changes to the COVID-19 Protection Framework (CPF). \u201cWith vaccine mandates to narrow on 4 April to only health and disability, aged care, prison and border workforces, we are providing updated guidance now to provide clarity and certainty to employers, \u201d Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood said. \u201cThe new workplace guidance is centred on public health advice, which suggests that requiring vaccination in the workplace should only be permitted if it's deemed an employee is at higher risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 while at work, than they would otherwise be in the community. \u201cEmployers may still be able to maintain vaccination requirements where they continue to be supported by a workplace health and safety risk assessment, but the reason will need to be specific to their role and set of circumstances. \u201cWe would anticipate this will significantly reduce the use of vaccine requirements in most settings and the circumstances are likely to be more limited than they have in the past now that Omicron has entered the community. \u201cEmployers should regularly review their workplace health and safety risk assessments and there are a number of public health factors outlined in the guidance that is recommended they consider as part of this process. \u201cIt is important for employers to keep in mind that normal employment law and processes continue to apply. Employers should be fair and reasonable in their employment decisions and work in good faith with employees and unions before taking any employment actions in relation to unvaccinated employees. \u201cIt is important that employers feel supported during this time of transition. That\u2019s why we have taken the time to develop comprehensive guidance, backed by public health advice that is reliable for employers. \u201cThese changes to the CPF have been informed by public health advice, and the latest international evidence available. With our high vaccination rates and the immunity acquired from the current outbreak, we can manage future waves of Omicron with less restrictive settings. \u201cVaccination (including boosters) continues to be strongly recommended as one of the key public health measures and provides significant benefits. \u201cI recommend that employers undertake an updated work health and safety risk assessment before proceeding with any employment processes they may have already in place. \u201d\u201cIt is also important to remember that the majority of New Zealand workplaces have not had a vaccination requirement in place and have managed well over this period. \u201cThroughout the pandemic, employers have shown their ability to adapt and respond to our changing environment while supporting employees. I\u2019d like to thank them for the part they continue to play in keeping New Zealanders safe, \u201d Michael Wood said.",

A shipment of 100,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine arrived in New Zealand today from Australia. \u201cEnough for 50,000 people, these doses are for people who can\u2019t have the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons, and for those who would like an option other than the Pfizer vaccine, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cFrom 26 November, anyone aged 18 and older who wishes to have the AstraZeneca vaccine will be able to book an appointment onBookMyVaccine.nzor by calling Healthline. \u201cDHBs are preparing to offer the AstraZeneca vaccine, including arranging for specific clinics to administer the vaccine, and making sure the workforce is trained to deliver it. \u201cAstraZeneca will be available at a limited number of sites across the country as Pfizer is the main COVID-19 vaccine we are using in New Zealand. \u201cOfficials have also been working closely with colleagues in Australia and with AstraZeneca to secure delivery of these doses from the manufacturer in Melbourne. \u201cWe want to thank the Australian Government for their cooperation in providing timely access to these doses and AstraZeneca for their support of this arrangement. \u201cNew Zealand has an advance purchase agreement with AstraZeneca for 7.6 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The 100,000 doses which have arrived from Australia are part of this original purchase agreement. The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group provided advice to Cabinet this week on the use of the vaccine in New Zealand. Cabinet has since granted a \u2018decision to use\u2019. \u201cPfizer remains the preferred COVID-19 vaccine for use in New Zealand and we have enough vaccine supply for everyone to be vaccinated, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cLooking at today\u2019s case numbers, and the current geographical spread, I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is that we have as many people as possible vaccinated. \u201cVaccination is the best way to protect ourselves, our wh\u0101nau and our communities against COVID-19. \u201d",

        "content": "Temporary COVID-19 immigration powers will be extended to May 2023, providing continued flexibility to support migrants, manage the border, and help industries facing labour shortages, Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi announced today. \u201cOver the past year, we have had to make rapid decisions to vary visa conditions, extend expiry dates, and waive some application requirements across entire visa categories. These decisions have provided more flexibility and certainty to visa holders and employers in New Zealand, and made more migrants availablefor industries facing labour shortages in a time when New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 health response needed our borders to be closed, \u201d said Kris Faafoi. \u201cWe have been able to make these necessary changes under the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Bill, which expires in May 2021. \u201cToday, I have introduced a Bill to maintain those powers until 2023. \u201cThe Bill will go through a short Select Committee process and is expected to pass in May. \u201dImmigration Ministers have used the powers to benefit classes of migrants 18\u00a0times, including:Extending visas for 22,500 workers and families members to give more certainty to them and their employersProviding 5,600 offshore resident visa holders more time to come to New Zealand and activate their visasExtending 16,600 visitor visas to give people more time to secure ways to return home, and allowing all visitors the opportunity to study or attend school while hereExtending 7,800 working holiday visas and easing conditions to allow holders to work in industries like horticultureWaiving certain application requirements for transit passengers and, more recently, for RSE workers\u201cNew Zealand is making good progress on the vaccines roll out. More will be announced next week regarding a travel bubble with Australia. And we continue to prepare for the eventual safe re-opening of our borders. But we know that COVID-19 is still widespread overseas, and it will take time for other countries to get the virus and its variants under control. \u201cThe extension to 2023 ensures our immigration system can continue to be responsive and flexible, if needed, over the next couple of years. \u201cThe Bill keeps in place existing safeguards. The powers can only be used for COVID-19 related matters and generally must benefit \u2013 or at a minimum, not disadvantage \u2013 visa holders, \u201d Kris Faafoi said.",

        "content": "The Government is reiterating its advice to all international travellers to do a Covid test if they become symptomatic after arrival, while also stepping up awareness of free RATs available at airports, Covid-19 Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall says. \u201cThis follows growing global concerns, including from the World Health Organisation (WHO) about lack of reliable data on case numbers in China and their work to address this, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cIn response, officials have done a public health risk assessment including working through scenarios of potential case numbers among travellers from China. This confirmed these visitors won\u2019t contribute significantly to our Covid case numbers meaning entry restrictions aren\u2019t required or justified. \u201cThere is minimal public health risk to New Zealand. We know that BF7 is the prevalent variant in China and that it hasn\u2019t caused significant outbreaks in other countries that, like New Zealand, have already been exposed to the BA5 variant. So public health measures are not required to protect New Zealanders. \u201cHowever we do share the WHO\u2019s concerns about lack of information sharing and this is why we will be asking travellers arriving from China to help us gather more information. In coming weeks we will temporarily be emailing a random sample of people recently arrived from China to ask them to undertake a RAT test and share that information with health authorities. It\u2019s entirely voluntary and we have had high uptake from international visitors when we used this method before. \u201cIt is important to note that new Covid variants can arise from across the world, not just China, which is why we\u2019re reminding arrivals from all countries to take the free RATs at the airport and test if they develop symptoms once in New Zealand. \u201cIn coming weeks, ESR scientists will also pilot testing of waste water from international flights and assess the feasibility of this method replacing the targeted and temporary voluntary testing that we\u2019ve announced today for travellers from China. \u201cTo conclude, being up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination \u2013 including with your booster vaccination, continues to be your best protection against hospitalisation and severe disease. The current vaccines remain effective at reducing risk of severe disease if you are infected with any of the variants currently circulating. \u201cNew Zealand continues to welcome visitors and tourists, and we ask that everyone follows the current public health measures which include staying home if you are unwell and isolating if you test positive for COVID-19, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said.",

        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Hon Nanaia Mahuta and Hon Aupito William Sio the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs today attended the virtual Pacific Islands Forum Special Leaders Retreat from Waitangi. During this Retreat, Pacific Leaders\u00a0 focussed on COVID-19 recovery and response, and in particular equitable and timely access to safe vaccines for the peoples of the Pacific. \u201cThe Forum plays a vital role in leading collective action on significant issues that affect us all. The health and well-being of Pacific populations and Pacific economic recovery is of utmost importance to New\u00a0Zealand, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cWe have already earmarked $75 million of Official Development Assistance to support Pacific vaccine access, including purchasing, planning, and delivery. We are working closely with Australia and other Pacific Islands Forum Members, as well as our regional partners, to ensure Pacific countries have the total support required to run successful immunisation campaigns. \u201dMinister Sio said he acknowledged the exceptional work that the Pacific region has collectively done in stamping out, and in many cases eradicating COVID-19. \u201cToday there is no issue more compelling and immediate than equitable access to vaccines for everyone in the Pacific. New Zealand is committed to ensuring everyone in the Pacific has access to a safe and effective vaccine and we will work across the region with Pacific member states, Australia, WHO, UNICEF, ADB and our external partners to make that happen, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. Pacific Leaders will discuss the appointment of the next Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum. \u201cI look forward to discussing with fellow leaders the importance of appointing a new Secretary General who can guide our collective response to shared regional issues, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. Notes for editors:The Pacific Islands Forum is the region\u2019s premier political and economic policy organisation. Founded in 1971, it has 18 members: Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.",

Both Ministers stressed that there are still a number of steps to work through before the vaccines can be delivered. The vaccine still has to be approved by Medsafe before it can be used in New Zealand and donated to Fiji. The Ministers met virtually last week to discuss New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s offer, which also includes $2 million of Official Development Assistance to support Fiji\u2019s vaccine rollout. \u201cFiji has worked hard to keep COVID-19 contained and New\u00a0Zealand has been committed to supporting it in this, \u201d Minister Sio said. \u201cBut this success has been hard won. Following recent community cases in both our countries, we see a vaccine as key to protecting our people from the virus, and for our economic and social recovery. \u201d\u201cFiji has chosen to roll-out AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine following earlier deliveries through the COVAX AMC and from India, and we are delighted New\u00a0Zealand has been able to support us to continue our campaign, \u201d Minister Waqainabete said. \u201cNew\u00a0Zealand is working hard to make that happen as soon as possible with a target of delivery for the third quarter of this year. Under New Zealand Health standards the AstraZeneca vaccine cannot be donated until it\u2019s approved by Medsafe, \u201d Minister Sio said.",

This follows a recommendation from the Ministry of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group that a second booster dose may be beneficial for those most at-risk of serious illness from COVID-19 and with a gap of six months from their previous booster. The vast majority of these people become eligible from July. \u201cA booster is important for our most vulnerable as we move into the winter peak. Several hundred thousand people will be eligible, which includes our older population, residents of aged care facilities, disability care facilities aged 16 years and over, and severely immunocompromised people aged 16 years and over and who have received a three-dose primary course and a first booster. \u201cFinal decisions on the make-up of this group will be made within the next two weeks. \u201cThe Government is working urgently to enable the second booster to be made available in the same way as the primary course and booster \u2013 that is, without needing to access a GP. This will be more equitable and make the roll-out to our at-risk groups more effective. \u201cWe intend do this by amending the Medicines Act, and anticipate the new policy will be in effect from mid June, in good time for the vast majority of eligible people. \u201cIf you are eligible but have had COVID-19, you will need to wait at least 3 months after your infection before having an additional dose. \u201cBased on current advice, for those who are not at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, a two-dose primary course and a booster dose provides very good and lasting protection, which is why we can be more targeted in the rollout of the second booster. \u201cWe know a booster helps reduce the chance of more serious infection, and it will be less likely that you need hospitalisation. And if you haven\u2019t had your first booster yet, it is not too late to get it in time for the winter season. \u201cThe Ministry of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group will continue to review new information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines and will make further recommendations if necessary, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

The pandemic continues to pose challenges for the sector, especially live events and performances during summer, \u201d Carmel Sepuloni said. \u201cThisArts and Culture Event SupportScheme is about providing certainty for event organisers, confidence for vaccinated New Zealanders to attend and enjoy events, and reassurance for artists and crew that they can get paid if their events can\u2019t go ahead as planned. \u201cI know that artists, crew and organisers are all eager to get back to doing what they love \u2013 putting on great events of all sizes and scope for New Zealanders. Knowing that this scheme exists to support them will be a big help over coming months. \u201dThe Arts and Culture Event Support Schemecovers events with attendee capacity of 100-5000 ticketed or un-ticketed, or more than 5000 un-ticketed (i.e. free). The scheme covers unrecoverable costs, payments yet to be made to the likes of artists and production crew, and reasonable costs to the promoter or organiser for the planning and development of the event. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged closely with ourarts and culturesector to develop the scheme, and we\u2019ll continue to work closely with the sector to ensure organisers know when, where and how to access the support they need. \u201cEvents will need to use the Government\u2019s My Vaccine Pass, in order to be eligible for the scheme. This is particularly important so that other vaccinated New Zealanders can enjoy confidence that the events they\u2019ll attend will be as safe as possible. \u201cArts and culture are critically important to our economy. Our $374 million COVID recovery package for the sector, including the $37.5 million Emergency Relief Package announced in September, underlines the social, economic and cultural value of the sector. \u201cI encourage New Zealanders to get out, enjoy the Kiwi summer and the freedoms it\u2019ll bring, book tickets, make plans to attend events and support local artists, musicians and shows\u201cWe all deserve to enjoy summer in Aotearoa with certainty and confidence. That\u2019s what this scheme is about and aims to guarantee, \u201d Carmel Sepuloni said. The registration process opens at 12pm Wednesday December 1. Event organisers need to register their event with MCH as soon as possible, so they can confirm their event\u2019s eligibility before their event date.

We reached two million doses on Tuesday and by the end of the week passed more than 2,200,000 doses in total. On the Wednesday we set a record of 45,082 doses in one day across the country. \u201cThe booking system continues to perform well with a record 296,650 vaccinations booked last week. We now have 1,009,536 vaccinations booked in the system. Over the last three days the 0800 call centre handled 27,695 calls with an average wait time of less than 1 minute. \u201cThis is a great all round response and means we\u2019re in position to open the 50-plus age band for vaccinations earlier than planned. \u201cPeople in the 50-plus group who are eligible don\u2019t have to wait to receive an invitation. They can make their own booking from Friday 13 August at 8am by visitingbookmyvaccine.covid19.health.nz, or by calling the 0800 28 29 26 COVID Vaccination Healthline (8am-8pm, seven days a week). \u201cPeople in other groups who are eligible and who are not vaccinated yet can also continue to book \u2013 there\u2019s no cut-off. \u201cConsignments of the vaccine continue to arrive as expected. \u201cOne million doses of the vaccine were delivered in July, and another 1.5 million will be delivered in August, 388,000 of these arriving yesterday morning. \u201d",

        "content": "Getting the right information is an important part of the process for wh\u0101nau, hap\u016b and iwi to be ready for the COVID-19 vaccination, Associate Minister for Health (M\u0101ori) Hon Peeni Henare said. \u201cWe are seeing progress in our communities to ensure M\u0101ori have the information and tools needed to make informed choices about the COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cI visited a number of rohe over the last couple of months and I am heartened to see the efforts being made by iwi, and hauora providers with the support of local health practitioners to ensure wh\u0101nau have quality information about the vaccine, \u201d Peeni Henare said. In March the Government confirmed the timing and sequencing of an initial $39 million to ensure the COVID-19 programme had a strong focus on protecting M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau and preparing M\u0101ori communities for the roll out of the COVID-19 programme. Of the $39 million there is $24.5 million for the development of community-based vaccine support services. This is allocated to a mix of vaccine support services for navigators, coordinators, champions across rangatahi, wh\u0101nau and community, and options for virtual support networks. Feedback from my visits and korero with M\u0101ori showed that there were still many of our wh\u0101nau who needed more information and they took the opportunity to ask questions about the vaccination roll out including safety p\u0101tai, whether the vaccine is free and when wh\u0101nau could get vaccinated. M\u0101ori providers have a vital role in ensuring a wh\u0101nau-centred approach to make it easier for wh\u0101nau, hap\u016b and iwi to get vaccinated. The $11 million allocated to the M\u0101ori provider fund for provider readiness will see more than 60 M\u0101ori vaccination providers delivering services across Aotearoa. Over half of those providers have already been contracted through the Ministry of Health with the remainder expected to be contracted as the programme scales up. \u201cWe now over 500 M\u0101ori trained as vaccinators with 150 already active in this kaupapa. We also have more than 26,000 M\u0101ori who have received their first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and over 11,000 who have received their second dose. \u201cAs we get closer to the next phase of the vaccination roll out we want to make sure that our people have access to information that is relevant to them in their rohe and kainga to make a confident and informed decisionThat\u2019s why we allocated $2 million for by M\u0101ori for M\u0101ori communications, \u201d he said. The fund enables a local communications response to inform iwi, wh\u0101nau, hap\u016b or hapori about the COVID-19 vaccination programme. A contestable fund of $1.5 million received 57 applications, representing 140 organisations, iwi and hap\u016b. The remaining $500,000 is allocated to the Iwi Communications Collective - 43 iwi communications practitioners working with, and for, their respective, iwi, hap\u016b and wh\u0101nau throughout Aotearoa. While our communities will be working on communications locally and regionally, there is also a greater M\u0101ori information sharing presence online. The Ministry of Health You Tube site has a series of videos hosted by Dr Lily Fraser. TheStraight Up seriessees wh\u0101nau raise their p\u0101tai about the vaccine. Te Puni K\u014dkiri also launchedwww.karawhuia.nz, a new site with trusted information to assist wh\u0101nau to make informed choices about the vaccine and a linked advertising campaign. \u201cAs the vaccine becomes available to more groups, and all of Aotearoa from July, ensure you have the information you need to play your part in protecting our wh\u0101nau, hap\u016b, iwi, and whakapapa\"added Minister Henare. Media contact:Irena Smith 021 845 205NOTES TO THE EDITOR:$24.5m is broken down into three components:$17.5m for vaccine support service which includes navigators and coordinators. This funding has been allocated to DHBs with baseline funding of 20 percent and 80 percent based on PBFF (Population based funding formula). This funding is for FTE support which will go directly to M\u0101ori Health Providers. $5.6m is for a virtual support network or Telehealth type service. $1.4m is for community champions. Discussions are being held on how to allocate this funding and the mix i.e. iwi, youth, wh\u0101nau, community.",

We can help reduce that by increasing vaccination rates even further. \u201cAround 64 percent of New Zealanders aged 65 and over have had their flu vaccine. This is the group most likely to end up in hospital so it would be great to get that number even higher. \u201cThe government has stepped up by funding free flu immunisations for over-65s, pregnant women, M\u0101ori and Pacific people who are aged over 55, patient and client-facing health and community care workers, and people with health conditions that put them at higher risk. \u201cIf you\u2019re in one of these groups and haven\u2019t had your flu jab yet then it\u2019s really important to get it now before the winter chills strike. Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves from getting sick, and from making others around us sick. \u201cPeople can get vaccinated at GP practices, pharmacies and many COVID-19 vaccination centres around all around New Zealand. Many employers offer free or subsidised flu jabs for their staff, \u201d Andrew Little said.

        "content": "Research into some of New Zealanders\u2019 biggest health concerns including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease is getting crucial support in the latest round of health research funding, Health Minister Andrew Little announced today. The funding, awarded through the Health Research Council of New Zealand, covers 31 General Project grants ($36.64 million), five Rangahau Hauora M\u0101ori grants ($5.91 million), five Pacific Project grants ($5.79 million), and four Programme grants ($19.99 million). \u201cThe Government is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders, and research is a vital part of the plan, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cThis significant investment has the potential to vastly improve the health of New Zealanders. \u201cThe research will investigate issuesranging from vaccine hesitancy through to improving genetic diagnoses for tamariki across Aotearoa, \u201d Andrew Little said. Included among the successful applications are projects led by M\u0101ori and Pacific researchers and driven by Kaupapa M\u0101ori and Pacific research methodologies that will help to reduce inequities in health for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples. One of the researchers receiving a grant in today\u2019s announcement is Dr Jason Gurney (Ng\u0101puhi) whoholds an HRC M\u0101ori Health Research Emerging Leader Fellowship. He is being awarded nearly $800,000 to explore the growing crisis of diabetes and cancer co-occurrence and its impact on what happens to people with cancer. The epidemiologist and senior research fellow at the University of Otago in Wellington wants to improve the quantity and quality of life for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples who develop the diseases. The two-year research project is a collaboration between the C3 Research Group and Professor Ross Lawrenson\u2019s research group at the University of Waikato. \u00a0It will explore the rapidly increasing rates of diabetes and cancer within M\u0101ori and Pasifika populations, and the impact of it becoming increasingly common for one person to have both conditions. \u201cAs I said earlier this year when I announced major reform of the health system, M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples are twice as likely to die young from conditions that could have been treated, and being M\u0101ori or Pacific even determines what sort of treatment you get. \u201cOur plan for dealing with this includes looking at why that is happening and finding effective ways to deal with it. Dr Gurney\u2019s research will help, and will also allow us to predict how many people are likely to have both diseases in future so we can plan for that. \u201cThe projects funded this year show New Zealand developing innovative approaches that will have an immediate effect on the health system, and that it has an agile and capable research sector that can respond to community needs and emerging health threats, \u201d Andrew Little said. More information and the full list of successful projects can be found on the Health Research Council\u2019swebsite. Background for editors:The Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC) is responsible for managing the Government\u2019s investment in health research. Each year the HRC offers funding for Projects, Pacific Projects and Programmes through an annual contestable funding round, awarding grants of approximately $1.2 million and up to $5 million for each successful proposal. Funded projects and programmes have a strategic, long-term vision that will contribute to significantly improving health outcomes for New Zealanders. This year\u2019s projects, to highlight a few, will:explore how the health system can better support and achieve health equity;gauge why some New Zealanders are refusing or delaying vaccinations;help boost immunity to the highly contagious disease measles in young adults;focus on more equitable access for lung cancer screening for M\u0101ori; andassess methods to help people quit smoking. The Health Research Council of New Zealandinvestsaround$120 million a year in research that improves the quality, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of New Zealand\u2019s health system, and contributes to disease prevention and living well.",

The Government is welcomingnewsthat more important medicines are to be publicly funded, thanks to a major increase in the budget of the national medicines-buying agency Pharmac. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement that Pharmac will fully fund Spinraza for people under the age of 18 is great news, \u201d Health Minister Andrew Little said. \u201cSpinraza is the first medicine for spinal muscular atrophy to be funded, and has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of the young people who receive it. \u201cComing on top of Pharmac\u2019sannouncement on Sundaythat it proposes funding Trikafta for people with cystic fibrosis, this is real evidence that the extra money we\u2019re putting into the health system and into medicines is paying real dividends for people with rare diseases. \u201cSince being elected in 2017, the Labour Government has increased the pharmaceuticals budget by 43 per cent, including an extra $71 million this year and $120 million next year, making more than 200 medicines and vaccines available to more people. \u201cI have also directed the Ministry of Health to develop the country\u2019s first rare disorders strategy, as recommended by the Pharmac Review panel, and I am pleased that Pharmac is using the extra funding we\u2019ve provided to make medicines available for people with rare diseases. \u201dPharmac also announced today that it is widening free access to the meningococcal B vaccine to include babies and young people living in places like hostels where they are in close contact with other people, and confirmed it will fund an oral version of a cancer medicine. \u201cBeing able to get vinorelbine as a capsule that you can take at home instead of having to travel to a hospital for intravenous chemotherapy will make life easier for hundreds of cancer patients, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cVinorelbine is used to treat lung and breast cancer, as well as some non-cancerous growths, so making it available as an oral treatment will be a real benefit to rural people especially, who often find it difficult to get to places where infusion services are delivered. \u201cThe Government\u2019s increase in the pharmaceuticals budget since 2017 has allowed Pharmac to fund 70 new medicines and widen access to another 134, with many more to come, \u201d Andrew Little said.",

        "content": "The Government has secured an extra half a million doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines from Denmark that will start arriving in New Zealand within days, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today. \u201cThis is the second and larger agreement the Government has entered into to purchase additional vaccines to meet the significantly increased demand through September before our large shipments land in October, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThese doses along with the 275,000 doses purchased from Spain last week provide an additional 775,000 to New Zealand\u2019s vaccine supplies. \u201cThere is now more than enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate at the world leading rates we were hitting earlier in the month, and I strongly encourage every New Zealander not yet vaccinated to do so as soon as possible. \u201cWe are extremely grateful to Denmark for making these vaccines available to help protect Aotearoa New Zealand against the current Delta outbreak. \u201cOur sincere gratitude is extended to Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her officials for their agreement and assistance to sell these doses to New Zealand. I wish to thank the European Commission for coordinating this purchase, as well as Belgium, for their role in producing the vaccine. \u201cThroughout the pandemic the team of 5 million has shown their commitment to keeping our communities safe. In 2020 we stayed home to save lives, in 2021 we need everyone to get vaccinated to protect family and loved ones and to prevent future lockdowns. \u201c76% of people aged 12 and older are either booked or have received their first dose, but we can\u2019t get complacent. Other countries with higher rates than this are still experiencing outbreaks, so we need to get vaccination rates up around the country and this extra supply will help with that. \u201cThis extra supply means we can continue to roll out vaccines well ahead of plan, so that everyone in New Zealand over the age of 12 can be vaccinated as soon as possible for free, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

We know that we all need to play our part \u2013 these vaccines will provide a line of defence to countries who most need it, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. The COVAX doses have been allocated to Samoa, which will receive 25,000 doses, and Indonesia which will receive 683,000 doses, to be delivered to the countries in October. These doses are in addition to our existing donation of 1.668 million AstraZeneca doses to COVAX, announced earlier in the year. \u201cCOVAX exists to enable global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring widespread vaccination around the world. New\u00a0Zealand is committed to supporting those efforts, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. \u201cAotearoa\u2019s deliveries from Pfizer will ramp up over the next few months to provide enough vaccines foreveryone in New Zealand to be vaccinated by the end of the year. We will also be able to assist our Pacific neighbours using New Zealand\u2019s surplus doses to support their vaccination programmes, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. New Zealand purchased additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine to help maintain the pace of the domestic roll out, and has now purchased over 10.8 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The surplus doses will be shared with the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. \u201cWe are sharing vaccines with our partners in the Pacific to help protect the region\u2019s precious tamariki and tamaiti against COVID-19. The donations will make a tangible contribution to COVID-19 resilience in the region, as many of these countries have large youthful populations, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. \u201cWe are also working closely with the governments of Tonga, Samoa and Fiji to donate vaccines for their younger population. These discussions are well underway, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. ENDS",

The package builds on previous tranches of assistance Aotearoa New Zealand has provided to Fiji, totalling over NZ$50 million. \u201cFiji remains in a very challenging position in their response to COVID-19 and our continued thoughts are with the Fijian people at this time, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cThis latest package of support will continue our efforts to assist the Government of Fiji and civil society partners to assist the most vulnerable communities impacted by COVID-19 over the next 12 months. \u201dThe new package will support ongoing equipment and supply needs, including testing capacity, oxygen supply and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) stocks. It will also be directed towards urgent and essential operations costs, including funding for technical assistance, surge support for Government operations, and support for monitoring of community isolation cases. New\u00a0Zealand will also contribute NZ$1 million to the International Red Cross Global Appeal for COVID-19 tagged to support the Fiji Red Cross Society\u2019s National Response Plan focused on vaccine roll out, blood donations and training of volunteers for home-based care. This latest announcement is in addition to the package of assistance announced for Fiji last month, including delivery of 100,000 doses of vaccines and funding the recruitment of 190 Fiji graduate nurses to provide surge capacity across the health system. \u201cNew Zealand is committed to supporting our Pacific neighbours through this global pandemic. The Delta variant has made the landscape ever more challenging and we continue to look beyond our own borders in the fight to eradicate COVID-19. \u201d\u201cWe continue to stay in contact with the Government of Fiji and civil society partners to respond to further requests of assistance, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said.

        "content": "On the occasion of the virtual Summit, on June 2 2021, between H. E. Ms. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, and H. E. Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez-Castej\u00f3n, President of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain. New\u00a0Zealand and the Kingdom of Spain:Welcomingthe existing strong links between the two countries;Asserting their firm commitmentto the defence of a more democratic rules-based, multilateral order and international institutions, and rules-based trade;Reiteratingtheir shared commitment to a values-oriented foreign policy that pursues democracy, sustainability, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, rule of law, human rights, with special emphasis on indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups;Determined towork towards a transformative, sustainable and inclusive economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic;Affirmingtheir common resolve to take decisive action on the urgency of climate change and environmental issues;Wishingto promote global peace, human rights and security;Committedto working more closely together to build a dynamic, strong, and forward-facing relationship to further advance these goals; andRecallingthe Joint Declaration and Plan of Action on International Relations and Cooperation concluded in 2009 between their Ministers of Foreign AffairsAdoptthis Joint Declaration. The Kingdom of Spain and New\u00a0Zealand, despite their geographic situation at the opposite ends of the world, share strong linkages and wish to deepen their ties and bonds through political dialogue, concerted action including in multilateral fora, trade and people-to-people relations. Furthermore, we have common views on the priorities needed to protect and promote a rules-based international order, with a strengthened United Nations at its core, adapted to enable the necessary transformations of our time, from the green transition to the technological revolution, and to better prepare our societies for the future. Hence, Spain and New Zealand commit to elevate the bilateral relationship to a Strategic Partnership based on the following elements.1. Bilateral RelationsTo pursue high-level political and strategic dialogue, both countries undertake first to carry out periodic, reciprocal visits at the level of Prime Minister and President of Government, when international travel and mobility allows. Foreign Ministers will meet and confer frequently. Political consultations at the level of Senior Officials\u2019 talks between our Foreign Ministries will continue to take place annually where possible, between alternate capitals. There will be a regular exchange of information and perspectives on areas of mutual interest through briefings and meetings with our Embassies in Wellington and Madrid. Such political consultations and exchanges of information will have a special focus on global governance; global political and security issues of shared concern; and regional matters (in particular, in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa). Together we will continue to work towards the prompt conclusion of bilateral agreements and arrangements under negotiation, in particular the Arrangement on Antarctic Cooperation.2. Global Values PartnershipNew\u00a0Zealand and Spain share a vision for the world we want to shape together. Our countries are globally oriented and seek to advance a rules-based international order through more and better multilateral cooperation. We both encourage and celebrate diversity. We are determined to advance in our foreign policies the goals of inclusive and more egalitarian societies; a sustainable, greener economy; and vibrant, resilient democracies where pluralism thrives and is reinforced by the technological revolution. The Global Values Partnership, co-led by New\u00a0Zealand and Spain, will put such values-driven policies at the forefront of our transformative foreign agendas. By launching the Global Values Partnership, Spain and New\u00a0Zealand will coordinate more closely their efforts to address global challenges and advance an agenda of reinforced multilateralism. We will seek opportunities to speak out together, and with others, carrying out joint, concrete actions in defence of our modern, democratic and internationalist values.3. Multilateral actionsNew\u00a0Zealand and Spain will continue our strong record of working together multilaterally, including by:Promoting global peace and security, responding to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, including online through our continuous support and endorsement of the Christchurch Call to Action. Promoting and protecting human rights and gender equality through support for multilateral and regional human rights processes, and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Strengthening the United Nations system so that it better addresses global challenges through concrete actions such as the initiative \u201cReinforcing Multilateralism Together\u201d, launched in Madrid on November 2020. Promoting respect for international law, including international humanitarian law; supporting international courts and others mechanisms to ensure full accountability for violations of international law, particularly international crimes, human rights violations and the use of chemical weapons; and upholding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which sets out the definitive legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. Enhancing regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America and Africa. Working together in support of Pacific Island countries including in taking ambitious action on climate change, amplifying Small Island Developing States\u2019 voices in multilateral fora, and regularly consulting on Pacific issues, including in relation to the European Union\u2019s contribution in the Pacific.4. Economy, Trade, Business, Investment, and TechnologyGlobalisation has enhanced connectivity between our two countries, brought prosperity to our societies, and improved the lives of millions. It has also posed challenges, and we must bring a broader perspective to economic transformation that puts at the forefront social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and gender perspectives looking for a level playing field for all. International trade and investment, within multilateral rules, has created an international economic order that has benefitted our economies. This order should be adapted and modernised to ensure it continues to work for all in the 21st Century. We strongly support the World Trade Organisation, its new leadership, and efforts to deliver concrete outcomes and a pathway for meaningful reform. We support the conclusion of negotiations for a comprehensive, balanced, sustainable and ambitious European Union-New\u00a0Zealand Free Trade Agreement. We are convinced that it will provide increased opportunities for trade and investment between our two countries, and could serve as a new-generation model for future free trade agreements in the world. We will foster greater knowledge and interaction between our respective business communities, including through two-way business delegation missions where possible. We will encourage continued trade and investment links between our two countries and a free flow of visits and contacts whenever possible. Digital technologies are having far-reaching impacts on our economies and societies. We will work together, including within the Christchurch Call to Action and in other relevant fora, to promote a free, open and secure internet, to advance a fair, inclusive digital transformation. We will strive to reach an ambitious, consensus-based solution on digital taxation within the OECD that ensures a fairer global fiscal regime.5. COVID-19 RecoveryTogether we will continue to advocate for sufficient production and equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines. We will continue to support the ACT-Accelerator and the COVAX facility, including through donating vaccines from our respective domestic portfolios. The world needs to increase global vaccine production capacity, ensure smooth supply chains, and remove trade barriers and logistical hurdles, ensuring universal access to vaccines as quickly as possible. Intellectual property rights should be part of the solution towards achieving universal access to vaccines, including through a temporary waiver. Our efforts in this respect will also benefit the access to vaccines for other transmissible diseases. Through our joint constituency of the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), we will continue to promote access to vaccines for children in the world\u2019s least developed countries. Together we will focus in particular on gender equality, vulnerable groups, Small Island Developing States, fragile states, and reducing barriers to vaccine access. The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased inequalities and fostered more geo-economic competition. In the short term, restoring a safe international mobility and ensuring adequate support to vulnerable sectors particularly hit by the crisis are key priorities. The impact of the pandemic alsoprovides an opportunity to build back better. Together, we will therefore advocate for a comprehensive green economic recovery that focuses on building sustainable, inclusive, carbon neutral, digital economies. This is also the moment to strengthen the global health system, adapting it to ensure the world is better prepared for any future global health emergency. We will closely consider the recommendations made in the final report of the Independent Panel commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO). Maintaining open trade flows in COVID-19 related essential goods is in our mutual interest, in particular critical medical supplies, vaccines and vaccine-related equipment. \u00a0We will share experience and knowledge on trade in COVID-19 related goods and on strengthening the future resilience of our global supply chain connections.6. Climate Change and EnvironmentAs we get ready for what must be an ambitious COP 26, we will deepen dialogue and our cooperation on climate change, recognising the urgency of climate action to meet the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal, including jointly advocating for international action to limit temperature to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. We will continue to work closely through the Carbon Neutrality Coalition, and to promote action on agricultural emissions through the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. We reaffirm our joint commitment to rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, recalling in particular Sustainable Development Goal target 12. C.7. Antarctica and oceansWe will coordinate closely on Antarctic issues, including the advancement of our shared focus on conservation of Antarctic marine ecosystems. We welcome the announcement of an international meeting in Madrid in October 2021 to mark the 30thAnniversary of the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection. We will also continue to coordinate closely on issues related to the ocean, including seabird conservation, particularly albatross and petrels.8. People to people, culture, education and sportsSpain and New Zealand are committed to advocating for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; this includes promoting women\u2019s leadership in our societies and their full participation in politics and institutions. Both our countries cherish the common values that sport helps to promote in our communities: team building, fair play, mutual respect, inclusivity, open participation and common rules. We recognise the contribution of sport to the relationship between our two countries and our people. We will make the most of opportunities to promote these shared values together through events such as FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2023, being co-hosted in New Zealand, and the Ocean Race 2022 that will start from Spain. The Memorandum of Cooperation on Education of 2010 has been the base for the promotion of Spanish language in New Zealand and for engagement of New Zealand in English language programmes in Spain. We will continue to explore options for more cooperation in the field of language education, exchange of language and culture assistants and support the work of the Cervantes Institute, the Prince of Asturias Chair at the University of Auckland, and Casa Asia, to further mutual cultural interaction and enrichment. We are also committed to fostering better mutual understanding through travel and contacts, especially among young people.",

No one is safe from this virus until we all are and this funding will mean more people in developing countries will be able to protect themselves and their families at this crucial time, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cAotearoa New Zealand is contributing a further $9 million to the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) to ensure developing countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines. \u201cThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained that equity of access to vaccinations must be a core feature of a global response. Our ongoing contribution reinforces our view that developing nations should not be hindered in their ability to fight the severe impacts of this virus on the health of their people and communities. \u201cAs one of the first countries to donate funds and vaccines to COVAX, we are a strong supporter of their efforts in ensuring widespread vaccination around the world, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. This funding brings New Zealand\u2019s total COVAX AMC contribution to $26 million. COVAX is the only global initiative working with manufacturers and governments to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both high-income and lower-income countries. It is co-led by CEPI, Gavi and WHO \u2013 working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others.",

They have been a core part of our wall of defence against COVID-19. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to hear the word MIQ and immediately associate it with heartache. There is no question, that for New Zealand it has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic. But the staff who worked in the facilities did so selflessly and deserve our thanks. \u201cMIQ staff have been at the front line of COVID-19 from the start. Prior to the vaccine they had no way to protect themselves from the virus other than PPE. \u201cWorking in MIQ often meant giving up on normal lives to protect others. I\u2019ve heard stories of staff being ostracised through fear of infection and isolating and changing their normal routines to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to others. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the burden they have carried and this recognition is the least we can do to thank them for their service and sacrifice. \u201cThe award will take the form of a lapel pin. Officials are working on design, eligibility and criteria with further details to come as the work progresses. \u201cThis award to the MIQ workforce is the first to be announced. Recognition will be extended to other groups who have contributed to New Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 response, with further announcements to be made in due course. \u201cOur COVID-19 response has and continues to be a true team effort that is not over, but the Government wants to ensure those on the frontline get the recognition they deserve for what they helped achieve, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

Northland, Auckland, Taup\u014d and Rotorua Lakes Districts, Kawerau, Whakatane, \u014cp\u014dtiki Districts, Gisborne District, Wairoa District, Rangitikei, Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts will move in at RedThe rest of the North Island will move in at OrangeThe whole of the South Island will move in at OrangeCautious approach taken initially as we transition into the new framework\u201cOn Friday the traffic lights are turned on for all of New Zealand, as we move forward safely into the next phase of our world-leading COVID-19 response, \u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared well for this moment by maintaining a cautious approach focused on protecting people and their jobs. Our next phase is focused on minimising the impact of COVID-19 and protecting people. \u201cWe\u2019ve vaccinated a significant portion of the team of 5 million, and now is the time to move to a new framework. \u201cWe\u2019ve come through the past two years of COVID in better shape than nearly anywhere in the world, with the lowest case and death rates in the OECD, a growing economy, and among the highest rates of vaccination in the world. \u201cWe\u2019re now in the strongest position to move forward into the next phase. \u201cThe certainty and stability of the traffic lights replaces the sudden lockdowns and restrictions of Alert Levels. Our schools will stay open at every colour and businesses will have protection through My Vaccine Passes to keep operating. \u201cOther than the existing Auckland boundary, which lifts on January 17, there will be no new restrictions on travel between regions. \u201cVaccinated New Zealanders using vaccine passes will be able to do many of the things that were previously treated as high risk like safely going to bars and restaurants, getting a haircut, and going to a concert or the gym. In Auckland, it means seeing friends and family indoors again. \u201cBut there is more to do. There are 160,889 Kiwis due for a second dose \u2013 if everyone got it this week we would be at 89.3 per cent fully vaccinated. I encourage those people to get their second dose today to benefit from the full protection of the vaccine, and to be able to get their Vaccine Pass. \u201cRed is the highest level in the new system, which is why Auckland has moved in at Red as the epicentre of the current outbreak, and we\u2019ve taken strong account of vaccination rates and vulnerable populations in the other regions at Red. \u201cRed provides extra protections against COVID-19 such as requiring both Vaccine Passes and some capacity limits in the most-high risk settings \u2013 that\u2019s because if someone has COVID-19, the virus will find it harder to spread among fewer people who are at a distance. \u201cAs we see what happens to cases and vaccination levels we can look to move regions down to Orange over time, where there are no gathering limits for those who are using vaccine passes. \u201cWe are not moving any regions to Green immediately while we continue to get vaccination rates up and transition the country to the new framework. To achieve this, $120 million continues to be distributed to support M\u0101ori communities to fast-track vaccination efforts and prepare for the traffic light system. \u201cBut COVID-19 is still with us, and the emergence of the Omicron variant overseas is a reminder of why we need to maintain a careful approach and keep public health measures in place to protect us. \u201cWe have been cautious with this initial designation of traffic lights as the new framework beds in. Cabinet will review settings and provide an update on Monday 13 December. The next update by Ministers will be on Monday 17 January, and will continue on a fortnightly basis. \u201cThe factors considered when setting the colours in each region include vaccination, the state of the health system, testing, contact tracing and case management capacity, as well as the rate and effect of COVID-19 transmission. \u201cWith 85 percent of New Zealanders now fully vaccinated, 92 percent with their first dose and boosters being already rolled out, we are ready to move forward in our next stage of the COVID response. \u201cThank you New Zealand. We\u2019re getting through our toughest period to date, it\u2019s been long but we\u2019re well set to move forward with caution into the traffic lights, into summer, into 2022, and beyond, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

        "title": "More free flu vaccines and a second COVID_19 booster to groups at risk of hospitalisation",
        "content": "The Government has widened access to free flu vaccines with an extra 800,000 New Zealanders eligible from this Friday, July 1Children aged 3-12 years and people with serious mental health or addiction needs now eligible for free flu dose. From tomorrow (Tuesday), second COVID-19 booster available six months after the first booster for older New Zealanders and other groups. The Government is ramping up access to free flu vaccines and COVID-19 booster shots for those groups of people who are being admitted in increasing numbers to hospital, Health Minister Andrew Little announced today. \u201cWe\u2019re making free flu shots available to another 800,000 New Zealanders, including children, more of whom are having to go to hospital, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cFree flu shots are already available for everyone over the age of 65 and those at risk of becoming seriously ill or who have underlying conditions. \u201cThis season we ordered 40 per cent more vaccines. We\u2019ve already seen more than one million New Zealanders get a flu shot, but with significant pressure on our health system we\u2019re ramping up efforts to get as many people vaccinated as possible. \u201cIn recent weeks we have seen a number of pre-school children hospitalised with the flu. We also know children can be transmitters of the flu to others in their family who are more at risk, so it makes sense to reduce transmission as much as we can. \u201cWe also know that people with serious mental health or addiction needs can get seriously sick from the flu, which is why we\u2019re also extending flu vaccinations to this group this year. \u201cThe extension of the free flu vaccination to more at-risk New Zealanders is just one of the actions we are taking to reduce pressure on our health system this winter, \u201d Andrew Little said. COVID-19 Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said a second COVID-19 booster was available for everyone over the age of 50 and recommended for anyone over the age of 65, as well as M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples older than 50 and people who are severely immunocompromised. \u201cThe availability of the second booster has also been extended to health, aged-care and disability workers over the age of 30, \u201d Dr Verrall said. \u201cFor those not at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, a two-dose primary course and one booster continues to provide very good protection. So, for thosewho haven\u2019t had a first booster, please act now. \u201dThe second booster dose should be offered six months after the previous dose, and postponed for three months after a COVID-19 infection. A second booster dose is not recommended for anyone who is pregnant and is healthy, including those with no underlying health conditions which could increase the risk of severe COVID-19. \u201cStaying up-to-date with the recommended COVID-19 vaccinations will continue to protect you from the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation or death, \u201d Dr Verrall said. \u201cThe Ministry of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Technical Advisory Group will continue to review new information on COVID-19 and vaccines and will make further recommendations on eligibility criteria as necessary. \u201cThe combination of Omicron and flu is making this winter more challenging than normal. The best thing New Zealanders can do to ensure they and their families don\u2019t end up in hospital is to be up-to-date with their flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters, \u201d Dr Verrall said. Anyone who is eligible for a second booster can get one without a prescription from a range of places, including walk-in and drive-through vaccination centres, booking online usingBookMyVaccineor by calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline on 0800 282926. Flu shots are available by booking with GPs or local pharmacies. Notes for EditorsFLUAs well as the expanded criteria for funded flu vaccinations announced today, flu vaccinations are also free for people aged 65 and over, M\u0101ori and Pacific people aged 55\u202fand over, anyone who is pregnant and people with underlying health issues like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. A record two million doses of flu vaccine are available this year, and so far just over a million people have been vaccinated. The widened eligibility criteria means more than 800,000 more\u00a0 people can now get free vaccinations \u2013 about 655,000 children and 170,000 people with serious mental health and addiction needs. Funding for three to 12-year-olds is for the 2022 flu season, while funding for people with serious mental health or addiction issues will be ongoing for future flu seasons. Those with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder or anyone currently accessing secondary or tertiary mental health and addiction services, will now be eligible for 2022 and future seasons. Walk-in vaccination options can be found viawww.health.govt.nz/fluand can get a flu jab from your doctor or usual healthcare provider, and at most pharmacies. COVID-19 Second BoosterThe second COVID-19 booster is available for everyone 50 years and older, and health, aged-care and disability-care workers over the age of 30 once six months has passed since a previous dose. The second dose is recommended six months since their previous for:People aged 65 years and over. M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and over. Residents of aged-care and disability-care facilities. Severely immunocompromised people who received a three-dose primary course and a fourth dose as a first booster (noting this would be a fifth dose for these people). People aged 16 years and over who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe breakthrough COVID-19 illness. Disabled people aged 16 years and over with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19.

        "content": "Deficit half of forecast at $9.7 billion; Deficits as a percentage of GDP running better than during GFCNet debt at 17.2 percent of GDP lower than Australia, UK, US and Canada. Core expenses $2.8 billion lower than forecast. Increased expenditure during year due to COVID-related expenses through unprecedented Delta and Omicron outbreaksStrong result allows for ongoing investment in core services like health, education and housing to occur amid worsening global economic challengesThe Government has delivered a set of books that are among the strongest in the world, ending the 2021/2022 fiscal year in a stronger position than forecast and ensuring New Zealand is well placed to respond to an increasingly volatile global economy. For the year to the end of June 2022, the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) recorded a deficit of $9.7 billion, roughly half of what was forecast just months ago at Budget 2022. \u201cWe\u2019ve delivered Government books that not only compare favourably with the comparable stage during the Global Financial Crisis, but across the key economic measures of growth, unemployment and Government debt we\u2019re in a better or similar position to the likes of Australia, the US, UK and Canada, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cOn the measures that matter the Government has steered the New Zealand economy and Government books through the 1-in-100 year economic shock of the pandemic favourably compared to the GFC \u2013 our economy has bounced back quicker, unemployment is lower, and the increase in debt compared to the size of the economy is comparable. \u201cOur Wellbeing Approach has also seen significant reductions in child poverty through this economic shock. We are building more houses than ever on a yearly basis and we have invested heavily in skills and training, with apprenticeships more than 50 percent higher than when we took office. \u201cThe result confirms that our strong health response during the Delta and Omicron outbreaks has also led to one of the best economic responses in the world. \u201cIn a volatile global environment it\u2019s critical the fundamentals of the economy are strong, and they are. Our economic and fiscal position means we are well positioned to address ongoing challenges while continuing to make investments in the critical services New Zealanders need. \u201cThe Government\u2019s strong finances allow us to focus on investing in what matters most to New Zealanders: growing wages and cost of living support, hospitals, schools, housing, and addressing climate change. The best investment in our economy is investing in our people. \u201cHowever, the global environment is challenging and will continue to put significant pressure on the Government books, so we will keep running a tight ship in order to achieve a return to the surpluses our Government posted pre-COVID. \u201cThe end of the 2021/22 financial year marks the closing of the COVID Response and Recovery Fund and the end of emergency spending. As I have already indicated over the coming year with COVID cost pressures reduced we will look to cut our cloth and carefully target our spending as we have done over successive budgets to meet our priority investments. \u201cCareful and balanced management will keep us on the pathway back to surplus. There is simply no room for unaffordable and untargeted tax cuts to those who need them the least. As we have seen, tax cuts with no plan for how to pay for them are economically reckless. \u201cWe have every reason to be feeling positive. Our borders are open, COVID restrictions are largely gone, and we are in a position to lock in the gains of near-record low unemployment, rising incomes and a larger economy than before COVID. We\u2019re set to accelerate our progress this summer as tourists and international students return, and working holidaymakers and skilled migrants fill workforce gaps. \u201cDespite the challenges the world throws at us, New Zealanders can be optimistic about our future. Our economy is doing better than predicted and with restrictions lifted we can seize the opportunities created by the Government\u2019s strong COVID and fiscal management, \u201d Grant Robertson said. Key resultsCore Crown revenue was 4.1 percent ahead of forecast at $117.5 billion, as the strong economic recovery boosted business results and led to more people in work, which contributed to higher tax revenue. Core Crown expenses were 2.2 percent below forecast at $125.6 billion, as our successful COVID response to the Delta and Omicron outbreaks meant allocated pandemic-related spending was not required in full. Some of these expenses, like ongoing investment in protections such as therapeutics and vaccines, will shift into the current fiscal year. Net debt ended the year at 17.2 percent of GDP, in line with Budget 2022 forecasts. This is one of the lowest levels in the OECD and well below the Government\u2019s debt ceiling of 30 percent, ensuring we are well positioned to weather further economic shocks. On a comparative measure produced by the IMF, our debt position as a percentage of GDP is roughly half the level of Australia, a quarter of the UK, and a fifth of the US.

In preparation, around 96 percent of its population are vaccinated providing a strong defence against the virus, \u201d Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cAotearoa New\u00a0Zealand has provided support to Tokelau since the outset of the pandemic, supporting preparedness through the provision of COVID-19 vaccines. \u201cAs they deal with their first cases, we are sending a shipment of further medical supplies including second booster vaccines, 11,900 RATs, PPE, and other essential equipment, alongside preparing to provide COVID-19 oral antivirals, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world, including in the Pacific. We know from our own experiences how challenging it is to deal with the virus, \u201d Associate Foreign Minister Aupito William Sio said. \u201cAotearoa New Zealand is working closely with the Pasifika Medical Association to respond to any needs for additional primary health care doctors and nurses, and we have also offered surge laboratory personnel. \u201cTokelau's high vaccination rates, preparations and support from the Polynesian Health Corridors team, should give assurance that they can still look forward to enjoying Christmas with their families, \u201cAupito William Sio said. \u201cThese supplies are part of our ongoing commitment support Pacific partners as they combat COVID-19. They will provide a line of defence to Tokelau and contribute to achieving a safer, prosperous and resilient Pacific, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said.

During the visit, Nanaia Mahuta met Niue Premier Dalton Tagelagi and Cabinet, and was the first outside speaker to address a special session of the Niue Legislative Assembly, the Fale Fono II. \u201cThis visit has allowed New Zealand to emphasise the strength of our special constitutional relationship with Niue as we continue to collaborate on areas of shared interest to both our countries and the wider Pacific region, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cWe know climate change is the number one challenge facing Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa \u2014 and our top priority moving forward. Premier Tagelagi and I discussed New Zealand\u2019s climate finance contributions, and how to enable Niue to meet its climate change priorities. \u201cWe confirmed a further $500,000 investment from our 2022-2025 international climate finance commitment, to complete design and planning for Niue\u2019s renewable energy projects. This builds on $5 million for solar generation from a previous climate package, announced by the Prime Ministerin 2018. Niue has a target of 80% renewable generation, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. The Minister visited Niue High School where she opened refurbished buildings upgraded by the NZ Defence Force in July as part of Exercise Tropic Twilight. She also discussed new initiatives to support the preservation of Vagahau Niue and other Pacific languages through greater collaboration, and sharing of teaching and learning resources. \u201cInvesting in the preservation and resilience of Vagahau Niue and other Pacific languages is a priority for New Zealand and our Pacific Peoples Minister. Our commitment reflects support for intergenerational and cultural resilience in the Pacific, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cThe whakapapa connections of te reo M\u0101ori and the languages of Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, including Vagahau Niue, provides a basis for a rich and productive partnership, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. The Minister also met with Niue\u2019s health workers and the Niue COVID-19 Committee to commend their efforts at keeping the community safe during the pandemic. New Zealand and Niue worked closely on theCOVID-19 pandemic response, including the provision of vaccines andsurge personnelto support clinical and public health teams. The Minister departed Niue for Tonga this morning.",

The vaccines will arrive in Fiji later today. \u201cAstraZeneca is Fiji\u2019s vaccine of choice and these doses will further support the excellent work Fiji is doing in vaccinating its population. \u201d\u201cEarlier this year New Zealand committed to providing up to 500,000 doses of vaccine to support Fiji\u2019s rollout. Fiji\u2019s vaccination programme is progressing well with 25% now fully vaccinated, and first doses provided to 82% of the population. Our commitment stands and New Zealand will continue to work with Fiji to confirm its remaining vaccine requirements, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. New Zealand is also funding the recruitment of 190 Fiji graduate nurses, for a three month period, to provide surge capacity across the health system including at Fiji\u2019s isolation facilities. \u201cThe recruitment of these nurses not only supports Fiji\u2019s response in the short term, but also contributes to the long-term resilience of the health sector, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said. Aotearoa has also responded to a range of other requests from the Fiji Government and civil society. \u201cIn the last two weeks New Zealand has supported the provision and retrofitting of ambulances and medical equipment, provided funding support to civil society partners and begun delivering 700,000 testing swabs and privacy screens for medical facilities, \u201d said Nanaia Mahuta. These initiatives build on previous packages of support New Zealand has provided Fiji to enable its COVID-19 response, including $40 million of financial assistance, PPE, testing equipment and other relief supplies. New Zealand has also deployed two rotations of medical personnel to the joint Australia New Zealand Medical Assistance Team providing surge clinical, logistical and public health support for the Fiji health system. \u201cWe remain in close contact with the Government of Fiji and civil society partners to support further requests, \u201d Nanaia Mahuta said.

The Prime Minister will conclude the week by chairing the APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting where the 21 Leaders will gather virtually to discuss the ongoing management of COVID-19 and further regional trade and economic cooperation between member economies. \u201cHaving convened APEC Leaders for an additional COVID-19 summit in July, this meeting will focus on charting a path to recovery out of this once-in-a-century crisis, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cAPEC\u2019s focus remains on the regional response and recovery from COVID-19. Together we are continuing to keep supply chains functioning and are supporting trade in critical medical supplies \u2013 including testing kits, PPE and now vaccines. \u201cThrough APEC Leaders we will build on the progress so far by energising the region\u2019s economic recovery, taking action to decarbonise our economies, and promoting growth that leaves no one behind, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Through New Zealand\u2019s hosting year, APEC economies have:agreed to help speed up the flow of vaccines and related goods across borders and reduced their costs;agreed a five year programme of work on economic reforms that will kick start growth, create new jobs and help combat climate change;laid the groundwork for a voluntary standstill on fossil fuel subsides \u2013 hundreds of billions of dollars are spent every year on subsidising fuels that harm our environment;agreed to lock in digital and paperless customs procedures, saving business significant time and cost by removing requirements for physical paperwork; andset a new roadmap to guide efforts to boost food security over the next ten years. \u201cIf there is one thing that we can be certain of right now, it is that no economy can overcome this pandemic alone, it will require all of our continued cooperation to secure a successful regional recovery for all, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cWe are not just focused on the here and now \u2013 but also focused on providing strong direction to APEC\u2019s work through to 2040 as we strive to reignite growth and respond to the challenges of the pandemic, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.

We purchased a portfolio of vaccine options to provide us with flexibility, and the approval of a second COVID-19 vaccine is welcome news. \u201cMedsafe follows a rigorous assessment process informed by the most up to date medical and scientific data. Approval has been very carefully considered with safety the key priority. \u201cThe medical evidence shows Janssen is a very safe and effective vaccine. It is a great addition to our vaccine options, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has also received emergency or provisional approval in Canada, USA and Australia. \u201cWhile our plan remains to ramp up the roll-out using the Pfizer vaccine from here, having the option of the Janssen vaccine increases our choices and provides us with flexibility if we need it. As a single dose vaccine, it may be useful in hard to reach locations or emergencies, or for those who cannot get the Pfizer vaccine. \u201dNew Zealand is already receiving significant deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine and has secured enough doses of the Pfizer vaccine for the population of New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours, in 2021. \u201cProvisional approval is the first step in the process. Cabinet will weigh up the options on the best use of the Janssen vaccine following advice from officials. A Cabinet \u2018decision to use\u2019 can be expected sometime in August, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOur roll out of the COVID-19 immunisation programme is well under way and we have a plan to offer a Pfizer vaccine to everyone in New Zealand by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a range of options to access safe and effective vaccines to meet the need of New Zealanders now and in the future. \u201d",

New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s approach will be to purchase sufficient vaccines to cover the Realm of New\u00a0Zealand (Tokelau, Niue, Cook Islands) and our Polynesian neighbours (Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu) should their governments wish to take these up. \u201cWe are best placed to support these countries directly because of our constitutional relationships in the Realm, and the strong links between our health systems and our close people-to-people ties across Polynesia, \u201d Aupito William Sio said. \u201cWe will also be scaling up existing health investments to enable us to play our part in vaccine roll-out. Included in the $75m support package, New Zealand plans to make a further $10m contribution to the COVAX Facility Advance Market Commitment, which is the key multilateral mechanism that has emerged to support equitable global access.

        "title": "Prime Minister_s Speech to NZIIA Annual Conference",
        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, ata m\u0101rie, t\u0113n\u0101 koutou katoa. It\u2019s a great pleasure to attend an event on such an important topic as New Zealand\u2019s future in the Indo-Pacific region. Thank you to the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs for bringing this hui together. I am encouraged to see so many young New Zealanders present. But I\u2019m also not surprised. As a high school student, I was fascinated by global politics. And at university, it wasn\u2019t domestic politics I primarily studied \u2013 it was international relations. In fact, I am not sure I have shared this with MFAT before, but as a student at Waikato University I recall one day seeing a flyer advertising the fact that representatives from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be on campus as part of their graduate recruitment programme. I took down the details and when the day arrived, I joined literally hundreds of others as we piled into a fairly packed lecture theatre to hear about what it took to be a diplomat. This was some years ago, but while I can\u2019t recall all that was said, I do recall two very important words \u2013 double degree. I walked out of there and decided that the entry criteria were a little too high for me. Apparently, I didn\u2019t apply that same logic for any of the roles I have taken on since. Over the years it has struck me though, how interested not just our young people, but our nation is in the politics and decision making of others. \u00a0It is easy to assume that all countries would take the level of interest we do in global affairs \u2013 but I can tell you that in my experience, they don\u2019t. How many other countries would for instance, factor in the timing of another country\u2019s election in relation to our own? I am still convinced that the last two American elections have probably captured people\u2019s attention to the same degree, if not more, than our own have. I can think of two reasons why this level of global interest persists in New Zealand. The first is size. We have an acute sense of our place in the world. But the second, is that we have all too often experienced the impact of others\u2019 decisions on us; the testing of nuclear weapons, dramatic changes in economic policy, war. We may be far from others, but we are not, and have never been, isolated from the impacts of global politics. \u00a0And you can see this acute sense of self and others in the fundamentals of New Zealand\u2019s foreign policy. Many of our current settings were established by Prime Minister Fraser, who was instrumental in establishing the United Nations under some of the most challenging international conditions imaginable. Peter Fraser recognised for instance that a lasting peace depended on a successful United Nations that collectively protected the sovereignty and independence of small countries. Those fundamentals remain, and they have been further reinforced by successive global challenges. We have entered an era of formidable environmental, health, and geopolitical difficulties. And in this era, each nation is faced with choices. We either ignore the impact our domestic decisions have on others and choose a path of isolationism and nationalism, or we take the view that concerted collective action is the necessary response. Here in Aotearoa New Zealand, the environment in which we are making our foreign policy decisions has changed, but the values we use to make those decisions have not. I want to spend a bit of time today talking about that environment and how we steady our ship in what often feels like ever turbulent seas, with a particular focus on your area of interest \u2013 the Indo-Pacific. To start- I have a question for you. Where do you see our place in the world?If you were to ask me, I would give you a very literal answer. The Pacific. This is our home. It is the region we most squarely identify with. We very literally share a population base. That\u2019s why, when we came into office, we focused immediately on lifting New Zealand\u2019s engagement with the Pacific region, delivering greater investment and building long term partnerships. Looking forward, we are focused on long-term resilience, with a high degree of Pacific ownership and innovation. But the Pacific itself is an increasingly contested region. And so, to understand that complexity, and respond to it, we also see the Indo-Pacific as central to our interests. We have embraced the concept of an Indo-Pacific as the wider home for New Zealand, locating Aotearoa in a larger ecosystem of nations and regions that includes East Asia, the Pacific, the Indian sub-continent and the Pacific Rim. M\u0101ori t\u016bpuna (ancestors) voyaged through the region. \u00a0More recent waves of migration have further entrenched this connection. It is a region where the rules-based international order has already supported huge improvements in human conditions, but is a region of deep diversity. The Indo-Pacific includes highly advanced economies Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and United States and Canada. China remains an engine of global growth and one of our most significant, but also one of our increasingly complex relationshipsAustralia \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s indispensable partner and ally with a strong track record of contributing in the region \u2013 sits at the intersection of both the Indian and Pacific oceans. The rapidly growing and demographically young countries of ASEAN have 650 million people and a rapidly expanding middle class. With all of this regional diversity, New Zealand is not alone in adopting an Indo-Pacific outlook. The ten countries of ASEAN plus Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Germany have also referred to an Indo-Pacific region in reaction to more challenging geopolitics. But while we welcome the concept of an Indo-Pacific region, we do so based on the principles that have served New Zealand well and are consistent with our values. From New Zealand\u2019s perspective, these fundamental principles include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Respect for rules: consistency with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation and overflight\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Openness: that the region is open for trade, investment, and the movement of people to support prosperity and open supply chains\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Inclusivity: that all countries in \u00a0the region can participate\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That sovereignty is upheld and respected\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Transparency: that states are honest about their foreign policy objectives and initiatives beyond their bordersIn our view, the Indo-Pacific region will need to conduct its affairs in accordance with these principles if it is to successfully address common challenges. Here, the principles of openness and inclusivity are especially key for New Zealand. Often language and geographic \u2018frames\u2019 are used as subtext, or a tool to exclude some nations from dialogue. Our success will depend on working with the widest possible set of partners. And so, as a region, what are the challenges that lie ahead of us, and how can we use these principles that are core to New Zealand\u2019s foreign policy approach to resolve them?The natural place to start is COVID. New Zealand has been pleased to contribute to other countries\u2019 COVID-19 responses, with an emphasis on the Pacific. That parts of the Pacific remain COVID-free has been an achievement. But economic impacts have been severe, nonetheless. Vaccines are a critical tool needed by every government to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on their people and economy. As has been said many times \u2013 we will not be safe, till we are all safe. A singular focus on vaccinating our own populations with little regard to others is a recipe for variants, and for possibly undermining the very vaccines we are working so hard to provide. That\u2019s one of the reasons we are working with our partners to support vaccine roll-outs to our Pacific neighbours, and others. The COVAX Facility has commenced deliveries of our donation of 1.66 million doses. Our contribution to COVAX of $17 million also means we are also supporting vaccination in the broader Indo-Pacific region and beyond. But more is required. Equitable access to vaccines for all countries requires global support. The COVAX Facility needs funding and donation of vaccine doses. New Zealand has been an early mover and I welcome recent donations from others, including the G7\u2019s commitment to provide 1 billion doses. Early in the pandemic we moved swiftly to support the Ejikman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta to help ensure Indonesia had the testing capability it needed to understand how the virus was spreading. When the pandemic intensified in Nepal, New Zealand moved quickly to release $1 million for UNICEF to support children and their families. In Viet Nam, both suffering from the economic shock from COVID and the collapse of tourism \u2013 our overseas development team pivoted to support training for women workers from the informal sector so they could support themselves and their families. In Timor-Leste the Royal New Zealand Air Force flew in much needed supplies of PPE as COVID started to break out. There are hundreds of similar stories from across our network of Embassies and High Commissions, where New Zealand has stepped up \u00a0to support the local COVID response. But now is the time to turn our individual action, into collective momentum. \u00a0That includes in our role as chair of APEC. There are over 100,000 new cases of COVID-19 in the APEC region every single day. \u00a0And more than 80 million people lost their jobs across our economies last year, during the biggest economic contraction since the Second World War. On Friday night I will chair the first ever extraordinary meeting of APEC Leaders. \u00a0This will be a unique opportunity to bring APEC Leaders together to discuss how to get the region through the health crisis and accelerate economic recovery in a way that lays the foundations for a better future. That better future, must surely include better levels of preparedness for the risks we all face. That\u2019s a challenge that extends beyond just APEC. It is clear our global community was not adequately prepared for COVID-19. It is also clear that COVID-19 will not be the last global health risk that we face. I want to put on record again, New Zealand\u2019s support for the ambitious and practical recommendations set out by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, co-chaired by Helen Clark. In keeping with our strong multilateral approach to global challenges, it is our intention to not just passively support these recommendations, but to actively engage on work-streams to develop a new pandemic Treaty; to improve global surveillance, validation and early response; and to strengthen the World Health Organisation. We see these areas of work as critical to our collective health and wellbeing, and a new frontier in which we believe New Zealand has a role to play alongside others. But COVID 19 has exposed other frailties we have all long been familiar with. As a trading nation, New Zealand has also focused on keeping markets and supply chains open during the pandemic, when for some governments there has been a temptation to turn inwards. Working with partners like Australia and Singapore, and through APEC, New Zealand has led political efforts to support regional supply chains and free trade in essential goods and medicines. New Zealand is focused on protecting the multilateral trading system at a time when it is under stress. This means working to ensure that the World Trade Organisation remains well-functioning. New Zealand has also maintained momentum in our trade negotiations, concluding the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the China FTA upgrade. And we continue to progress a full negotiating agenda, with the European Union and United Kingdom negotiations well-advanced, and an upgrade of our FTA with ASEAN under way. New Zealand actively encourages other economies to join the economic agreements we have initiated \u2013 including countries from outside the region. Last month we joined consensus on the formation of a working group to negotiate the UK\u2019s accession to CPTPP. Other economies will be able to join CPTPP too. CPTPP is our highest quality agreement. \u00a0Those aspiring to join will have to be able to meet its high standards. But before I roam too widely from a discussion on regional architecture, it would be remiss of me not to mention the importance of ASEAN. ASEAN is a source of economic opportunity and diversified trading relationships. Our dialogue partner status with ASEAN has enabled some of our most important free trade agreements. And people from South East Asia have contributed richly to New Zealand. Our relationship with ASEAN gives New Zealand a seat at the region\u2019s top table for strategic discussions \u2013 the East Asia Summit, and is the convening body for regional diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific. And the proof is in the pudding. ASEAN has helped keep members at peace with one another since the end of the Vietnam War. Our partnership with ASEAN is also a case where New Zealand can pursue cooperation that is principled and pragmatic. The trajectory of political development in South East Asia is uneven, with democracy in retreat in some places and grave human rights abuses occurring around the region. We are concerned for instance by the trampling of democracy by Myanmar\u2019s military \u2013 the Tatmadaw. \u00a0We have expressed our condemnation of the coup and have taken steps to pressure Tatmadaw leaders towards the return to civilian government. New Zealand sees it as critical that the regime releases those people arbitrarily detained since the coup, including foreign nationals and political prisoners. We also have serious concerns over the situation in the South China Sea, including artificial island building, continued militarisation, and activities which pose risks to freedom of navigation and overflight. Climate change is a grave threat to low lying South East Asian countries as well as to Pacific Island states. The majority of global carbon dioxide emissions come from the Indo-Pacific region. Here, we have a role to play in ensuring our regional architecture is up to the challenge. Trade can be a key part of the climate solution, by removing barriers for environmentally-beneficial goods and services, and eliminating government subsidisation of fossil fuels. APEC trade ministers have agreed to consider options for ending new subsidies on fossil fuels. And New Zealand is leading negotiations of the first-of-its-kind trade agreement - the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability. But it continues to be the case that New Zealand can best give effect to our foreign policy in partnership with others. Our independent foreign policy has never meant that we pursue our objectives on our own. We will increasingly prioritise and progress our interests through multilateral mechanisms but also through regional partnership. I understand that later this morning, White House Asia Coordinator Kurt Campbell, who knows our region well, will address this meeting. We look forward to working with the Biden Administration on regional issues. \u00a0New Zealand\u2019s relationship with the United States has deep roots, built over many decades of cooperation. We share values and have common interests in how the region operates. To conclude, the Indo-Pacific is to some degree at an inflection point. The forms of cooperation needed to overcome COVID-19 require countries to let go of narrow nationalistic approaches. A full economic recovery can only come after other countries vaccinate their populations and suppress the virus\u2019 transmission. The post-Covid world will be a new era. Our goal has to be to make it a better era, and if the Indo-Pacific is to successfully rise to the many challenges it faces, governments will need to re-commit to supporting an open and rules-based regional order; one that\u2019s more sustainable and resilient. And we must recommit to doing what we can, to encourage that change. We will do so in ways that are pragmatic, that advance our interests, and that are consistent with New Zealand\u2019s values. We will do so in a variety of formats \u2013 through private diplomacy or through public statements on our terms, sometimes speaking out alone \u2013 at other times in concert with governments who share our concerns. An independent, principled foreign policy is a powerfully simple concept. As Norman Kirk described it, \u201cwe want New Zealand\u2019s foreign policy to express New Zealand\u2019s ideals as well as reflect our national interests\u201d. That means that while New Zealand must work with the region as it is, we are also clear on what we stand for: the rule of law, human dignity, and universal human rights. And that\u2019s why we will encourage partners to continue on the pathway of democratic reform \u2013 just as New Zealand continues to improve its own political system \u2013 to protect the institutional enablers of democracy: free and fair elections, an independent judiciary, a free press, and freedom of assembly and association. New Zealand ultimately aspires for the Indo-Pacific region to become freer and more open. As the region emerges from the pandemic, we hope it will be both.",

Fitch hastodayaffirmed New Zealand\u2019s local currency rating at AA+ with a stable outlook and foreign currency rating at AA with a positive outlook. The agency praised the Government\u2019s policy framework, saying the robust public health and macro-policy response to the global COVID-19 pandemic has enabled New Zealand to weather the economic shock exceptionally well by global standards. \u201cThis is further confirmation that our decision to move quickly to protect our people and our economy was the right one, as COVID-19 took hold overseas. We used our strong balance sheet to support our workers and businesses through lockdowns as well as keeping in place a buffer in the case of a resurgence, \u201d Grant Robertson said. Fitch also noted the Government\u2019s effective suppression of COVID-19 domestically and its policy response has meant New Zealand is in a V-shaped economic recovery, with GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels by the September quarter last year. \u201cThe economic bounce back was a result of our decision to act swiftly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We supported 1.8 million workers through the Wage Subsidy Scheme and invested billions in infrastructure, training and creating jobs, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cWhile there are vaccines being rolled out in countries seriously affected by COVID-19, the world is by no means out of the woods yet. There is still a huge amount of global uncertainty in the face of new strains of the virus and continued struggles in many countries to contain COVID-19 domestically. \u201cWe went into the economic shock caused by the global pandemic with our finances in good shape, including with very low public debt. While we have borrowed more to protect our people and economy, our net debt as a percentage of GDP remains lower than many of our international peers, \u201d Grant Robertson said.",

Today\u2019s funding announcement is part of the first phase $60 millionfocused on vaccination rates and a further $60 million will support M\u0101ori and iwi-led initiatives to protect their communities against COVID-19. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and M\u0101ori Crown Relations Minister Kelvin Davis are in Te Tai Tokerau today seeing first-hand some of the successful vaccination initiatives being rolled out in M\u0101ori communities. \u201cWe know that local solutions are how we are going to reach the rest of Maori with our vaccination message, \u201d Kelvin Davis said. \u201cThere are an army of volunteers, iwi and M\u0101ori organisations already working hard on this mahi and with the funding provided their efforts will be supercharged. \u201dThe M\u0101ori Communities COVID-19 Fund was announced just over a week ago. Minister for M\u0101ori Development Willie Jackson, on behalf of the Ministerial Oversight Group reviewing funding proposals, said the quality of the proposals supported the swift decision-making needed to accelerate vaccination rates for M\u0101ori. \u201cThe task now is to put our foot on the pedal and reach M\u0101ori, particularly in high priority and low vaccination areas like Te Tai Tokerau, Counties Manukau, Lakes District, Taranaki and Tair\u0101whiti DHBs, \u201d Willie Jackson said. Associate Health Minister Peeni Henare said it was community mobilisation that was making all the difference. \u201cM\u0101ori passed 70% having their first jab last Friday. I want to mihi all the hard-working M\u0101ori providers, iwi and community groups who, with DHBs, supported wh\u0101nau to reach that milestone, \u201d Peeni Henare said. Te Puni K\u014dkiri and Te Arawhiti will now work through funding contracts with the successful M\u0101ori organisations and iwi. The first of the Phase One funding round proposals include:Te Tai Tokerau ($4.6 million):includes support for iwi and marae communities, mobile vaccination clinics, events for rangatahi, and targeted communications and 0800 call centre. \u00a0 This includes priority areas such as Kaikohe, Otangarei, Raumanga and Kait\u0101ia East and West. T\u0101maki Makaurau ($1.8 million):includes funding for mobile vaccination clinics, w\u0101nanga, clinical staffing and health promotion resources. Priority groups include rangatahi, hard to reach wh\u0101nau who are vaccine-hesitant, kura kaupapa and bilingual schools. Waikato-Waiariki ($4.95 million):funding to reach isolated wh\u0101nau and communities including transport for mobile vaccination clinics, clinical staff and wrap-around support, addressing vaccine hesitation, and community outreach and events. North Island \u2013 ($5 million):extension of existing funding for the Whan\u0101u Ora Commissioning Agency including vaccination programme, providing vaccine delivery and pastoral support across more than 80 Wh\u0101nau Ora providers. Also, incentives and activities (e.g. kai, petrol vouchers and essentials) for rangatahi, wh\u0101nau and M\u0101ori communities to encourage vaccination. Taranaki ($1.3 million):includes funding for eight iwi in Taranaki to increase trained vaccinators, recruit nurses, and kai\u0101rahi to set upHeretaunga ($2.2 million):building on successful vaccine mobilisation and events to address accessibility issues, facing M\u0101ori in the rohe; transport, mobile vaccine clinics, community champions, events and incentives, particularly targeting rangatahi as 50% of the rohe M\u0101ori population is 10-29 years. Whanganui ($2.8 million):funding for iwi covering Southern Taranaki, Rangit\u012bkei and Ruapehu district for community resilience and vaccination response including:\u00a0 digital data capture of M\u0101ori vaccination rates; mobile outreach and vaccine incentives and events and communication of information and community engagement to reduce misinformation. Te Waipounamu ($0.7 million):funding to accelerate M\u0101ori vaccinations and build on the previous work of Te P\u016btahitanga o Te Waipounamu Wh\u0101nau Ora agency including:\u00a0 vaccination clinics, events, mobile outreach, food distribution, communication and removing barriers to vaccination. \u00a0 All of South Island and targeted initiatives to Invercargill, Alexandra, \u014ctautahi and Te Tai Poutini. The M\u0101ori Communities COVID-19 Fund involves a two-phase approach focused on further mobilising local vaccination initiatives for wh\u0101nau, and on supporting M\u0101ori, iwi and communities to prepare for the new protection framework. Further proposals for the $60m Phase One initiative, focused on vaccination, will be considered by the Ministerial Oversight Group this week.",

The shipment of around 60,000 doses arrived as airfreight at Auckland International Airport at 9.34am today. \u201cThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine\u2019s arrival allows us to start New Zealand\u2019s largest-ever immunisation programme, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cBetween now and when the vaccination programme starts, quality assurance, and checks by Medsafe and the pharmaceutical company will be undertaken. \u201cWe expect to start vaccinating border and MIQ workers in Auckland this Saturday. The more than 30,000 courses will be more than enough to vaccinate this group of workers over the coming 2-3 weeks. \u201cOur border workforce such as cleaners, the nurses who undertake health checks in MIQ, security staff, customs and border officials, airline staff and hotel workers have worked tirelessly to keep all New Zealanders safe and will rightly be first to receive the vaccine. \u201cWe know they\u2019re most at-risk of coming into contact with the virus and that\u2019s why we\u2019re targeting them first, as it will also help prevent COVID-19 entering our communities, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said that since arriving this morning, the shipment has had\u00a0further checks to confirm it has arrived safely and intact, and has been kept at the correct temperature during its flight here - it must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius. \u201cThis has been completed and the vaccine has been formally transferred to our ownership and has been transferred to our new ultra-low temperature storage facility in Auckland, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting further shipments of vaccine over coming weeks and will receive about 225,000 vaccine courses by the end of March. \u201cAs these batches arrive, we\u2019ll vaccinate border workers\u2019 household contacts, then the next group will be many frontline healthcare and essential workers, plus those most at risk from COVID-19, such as older people or those with medical conditions that make them vulnerable if infected. \u201cThis is another important step in the roll out of New Zealand\u2019s vaccination programme and our efforts to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "Being up to date with vaccinations, staying home if unwell and wearing masks in healthcare settings remains key to minimising the impact of COVID-19 and reducing pressure on our health system over winter, Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall said today. Cabinet has agreed to retain mandatory measures for cases to isolate for 7 days and retain the mandatory use of masks for visitors to health care settings. However Cabinet has asked for more work to be done on whether testing to return to work earlier than the 7 days for people who are not symptomatic or are mild cases could be a safe and effective model to reduce the impact on workforce this winter. \u201cWe know isolation for COVID-19 cases is the best way to break the chain of transmission to make sure people aren\u2019t passing on the virus and getting other people sick, \u201d Minister Verrall said. \u201cIsolation remains effective in managing spread and keeping case numbers down, and it also helps reduce pressure on our hospital services. \u201cBut we need to make sure our settings are right, and look at examples of what is working around the world. A test to return to work rule for lower risk or mild or asymptomatic cases could help reduce the strain on some workforces this winter. \u201cCabinet will consider advice on this within the next two months. \u201cWearing face masks in healthcare settings remain an important tool to reduce your own risk and also the risk for others, especially those more vulnerable or susceptible to the virus. These settings will remain for now. \u201cI also urge those eligible for the new COVID-19 bivalent vaccine to get themselves vaccinated, and boosted when eligible, \u201d Minister Verrall said. Cabinet has agreed today to remove the legal framework around the Point of Care Tests Order, which regulates the importation, manufacture, sale and use of tests such as rapid antigen tests (RATs). This Order was originally enacted under the elimination strategy when there was no access to approved self-tests and is no longer necessary.",

In a suite of announcements that establish a pathway out of restrictions the Government is also providing up to $940 million per fortnight to support businesses through the challenging period, particularly those in Auckland. $120 million is also being provided to accelerate M\u0101ori vaccination rates in the coming weeks. \u201cOur current alert level framework and elimination strategy kept us safe and the economy functioning while we vaccinated but now as more Kiwis are protected by the vaccine we need a new plan to that moves away from lockdowns as our primary defence against the virus, \u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThe new COVID-19 Protection Framework sets a pathway forward that rewards the rapidly growing number of vaccinated New Zealanders with more freedoms to go about their lives safely. \u201cThe simplified framework has three levels: green, orange and red. Vaccine certificates will provide greater freedoms at each level, and there will be extra public health precautions built in at higher levels to minimise the impact of COVID-19 and suppress the spread of the virus, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. The new traffic light framework will allow businesses previously considered high-risk to fully open to vaccinated customers at green and orange and continue to operate with some restrictions at red. Businesses that choose to open to the unvaccinated will face restrictions in order to suppress the virus amongst those most likely to have it. \u201cFully vaccinated people will be able to reconnect with family and friends, go to bars and restaurants and do the things they love with greater certainty and confidence. The framework also provides businesses greater certainty to plan and grow, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cIf you are still unvaccinated, not only will you be more at risk of catching COVID-19, but many of the freedoms others enjoy will be out of reach. No-one wants that to happen but we need to minimise the threat of the virus, which is now mainly spreading amongst unvaccinated people. \u201cThese new requirements are a strong incentive for those who still haven\u2019t had their first dose to do so quickly. The choice is clear for anyone who wants to go to a bar, restaurant, gym or to attend gatherings. \u201cThe framework maintains the ability to move up levels when needed to control an outbreak, but is more flexible than the current alert level system. \u201cThat is because there is clear evidence the virus finds it harder to spread in vaccinated environments which is why businesses that provide services only to vaccinated people can operate at every level of the new framework and without any restrictions at green and orange. \u201cTesting, contact tracing and isolation will continue as key tools to minimise any spread of the virus. And localised lockdowns will still be an option if we see a rapid growth in cases in areas with high levels of unvaccinated people. \u201cA target of 90 percent fully vaccinated across each DHB region has been set as the milestone to trigger moving the country into the new system. This target ensures good regional spread across the country and will also help address equity issues within each region. \u201cModelling shows having 90 percent of eligible people fully vaccinated provides a high level of coverage, keeping most New Zealanders safe and helping slow and control outbreaks, assisting public health authorities to do their job. \u201cAuckland will be able to move sooner. This plan provides a clear path for Auckland to move out of lockdown as soon as 90 percent fully vaccinated is reached in each of the city\u2019s three DHBs. \u201cUltimately we have balanced the desire to re-open quickly while continuing to keep people safe. This plan is unique to New Zealand and rewards New Zealanders who have chosen to be vaccinated, while also giving us the flexibility to step up our response if needed. \u201cHigh vaccination rates is also an important step to allow us to reconnect New Zealanders to the world. \u201cAs we move through the most challenging part of the vaccination campaign this is the clearest incentive we can offer to people to get vaccinated. If you want to do the things you love then you need to get vaccinated. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t booked a first dose \u2013 do it today. It\u2019s how we win our freedoms and do the things we love doing. It\u2019s our ticket to summer, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

        "content": "Parents and caregivers will have the opportunity to protect their children aged 5 to 11 against COVID-19 with the child version of the Pfizer vaccine, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today. \u201cA key focus of the Government is to keep everyone in New Zealand safe from the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Cabinet has agreed with the advice from the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group, off the back of Medsafe approval that confirms both the safety and efficacy of the paediatric vaccine, to use of the vaccine to protect 5 to 11-years-olds. \u201cThis will happen from 17 January. There are 476,000 children between ages 5-11 who will become eligible to get their first dose from this date, and their second dose at least eight weeks later. \u201cAs we have seen to date, the virus can be unpredictable. While COVID-19 generally has milder effects in children, with symptoms similar to a cold, some children become severely ill and require hospitalisation. \u201cIn the most recent outbreak, 24% of cases have been aged 11 or under. \u201cLike we have seen with adults, if your child is infected with COVID-19 they may transmit the virus to other people. Immunising 5 to 11-year-olds helps protect wh\u0101nau members whose health makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19. \u201dThe Ministry of Health is working with iwi, DHBs, \u00a0hauora\u00a0providers, and community organisations to roll out the Pfizer vaccine to children in ways that suit\u00a0wh\u0101nau\u00a0and communities. While there are no plans for a school-based immunisation programme, schools are being considered as community vaccination sites. This will add capacity to the vaccination network and make it even easier for families to get vaccinated. \u201cThe government is strongly encouraging parents to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19, but I want to be clear that this is a choice for parents. The Government has no intention of making COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for anyone in this age group, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cI encourage parents to make an informed choice and have their children vaccinated to protect them and those they love. \"Notes for editors:Children need two doses of the vaccine to be fully protected. It is recommended that these are given at least 8 weeks apart, however the interval can be safely shortened to a minimum of 21 days if needed, for example if your child is starting significant immunosuppression treatment. The vaccine is free. A parent, caregiver or legal guardian will need to accompany your child to their appointment(s) as the responsible adult and provide consent for them to be vaccinated. The vaccine has been through clinical trials in children of the same age group. In general, the side effects that were reported were mild, didn\u2019t last long, and were similar to side effects from other routine vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis are very rare but serious side effects of the Pfizer vaccine. In the clinical trial no cases were seen in children aged 5 to 11 however it is important to be aware of the symptoms for all ages who are vaccinated. The Covid-19 Vaccination Technical Advisory Group (CV-TAG) and Medsafe will continue to monitor safety data, including for these rare side effects, from the rollout of programmes to 5 to 11 year old children in other countries. Parents or caregivers can go to a walk-in clinic with their tamariki or use BookMyVaccine.nz to get immunised with their usual health provider, hauora, or general practice (make sure you select the appropriate age range).

        "content": "The Government is responding to the need by wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori and M\u0101ori Health providers to support their ongoing work responding to COVID-19 and to continue increasing rates of M\u0101ori vaccination, Associate Minister for Health (M\u0101ori Health), Peeni Henare and Minister for M\u0101ori Development Willie Jackson announced today. This increased funding of $38 million will ensure M\u0101ori health providers provide ongoing support to M\u0101ori communities while responding to COVID-19. It comes after engagement with the M\u0101ori health and disability sector, which showed providers are struggling to support the COVID-19 response within their current resources. \u201cM\u0101ori are one of the most at-risk communities for COVID-19 and vaccination rates for M\u0101ori are behind the general population. However M\u0101ori health providers are well connected to their communities and have demonstrated their ability to protect wh\u0101nau and get them vaccinated so we are increasing their support so they can keep doing that work without having to pull back, \u201d Peeni Henare said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical we put further resource into our M\u0101ori health providers at this time, especially with the increased risk posed by Delta and the current push to increase M\u0101ori vaccination rates. \u201cThere is clear evidence that M\u0101ori health providers are making inroads into our hard to reach communities and those who may be vaccine hesitant. It\u2019s important they can continue this work with the funding and resources they need, \u201d Peeni Henare said. Out of the total fund, $17 million will go to providers to help them adapt their current services to support the response, whilst also maintaining other essential services. \u201cOur M\u0101ori health providers have told us they\u2019re under immense pressure with increased demand to support testing, contact tracing, case management, and vaccinations, while also trying to keep up with their other work. \u201cThis funding ensures our providers can continue to support their communities without burning out or losing capacity, \u201d Peeni Henare said. \u201c$14 million of this funding will ensure wh\u0101nau, especially those living in hard-to-reach areas, are able to access testing, vaccinations, medications, and other essential health services. \u201cAs well as taking care of their physical needs, it\u2019s also important wh\u0101nau are able to access mental health and wellbeing support. So, a further $3 million will be invested in a multi-media campaign and community programmes, \u201d Peeni Henare said. A portion of this funding has also been allocated to directly support wh\u0101nau, many of whom have been put under considerable stress through this recent outbreak. \u201cAn additional $2 million will ensure providers can work through the long tail of this current outbreak and prepare for future outbreaks, \u201d Peeni Henare said. Willie Jackson said today\u2019s announcement was a culmination of work done between the Ministry of Health and Te Puni K\u014dkiri. \u201cThis funding is about supporting those who are most vulnerable, wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori. We know what\u2019s happening on the ground within our communities and the importance of vaccinations, \u201d Willie Jackson said\u201cThis announcement demonstrates the Government\u2019s willingness and confidence to invest in Maori providers to deliver to our communities. That\u2019s why TPK will kick-in $2 million immediately to get the project underway, \u201d Willie Jackson said. The $2 million is part of a $5 million reprioritised fund from the COVID-19, 2021 Wh\u0101nau Recovery Fund, announced earlier this month to provide immediate relief to vulnerable wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori and communities during the current COVID-19 outbreak. The $2 million will go to M\u0101ori health providers who work directly with TPK, supporting community driven, local responses to gaps in access and provision of critical services such as vaccination. \u201cI am incredibly proud of our M\u0101ori health providers and the work they do for wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori. Their passion and dedication to their communities is an exemplar for the rest of the health and disability system \u2013 me mihi ka tika, \u201d Peeni Henare said. Media notesThe $36 million (Ministry of Health) will be split across four priority areas:$17 million has been allocated to help providers adapt their services to support the COVID-19 response, whilst also maintaining their other essential health services. This funding will also resource additional staffing requirements and offer any staff wellbeing support to sustain the workforce. $14 million will help wh\u0101nau access health services, medications, and hygiene products. It will also help provide greater reach of vaccination, testing, and other health services to hard-to-reach areas. $3 million will strengthen the M\u0101ori psychosocial response, ensuring wh\u0101nau have access to mental health and wellbeing services. $2 million will ensure providers have sufficient funding to manage the long tail of this response, sustain their efforts, and help them prepare for future outbreaks. This funding will be distributed to providers through both existing contracts and a streamlined contestable process. Providers who are already part of the COVID-19 M\u0101ori health response with current contracts will be able to assess this funding through a variation to contract and for other providers, there will be an application process. The Ministry of Health will provide additional details on their website. The $2 million (Te Puni Kokiri) will be funded towards:$2 million to assist M\u0101ori health providers who work directly with TPK to support community driven, local responses to gaps in access and provision of critical services such as vaccination. To apply for funding, M\u0101ori and iwi organisations need to contact their local Te Puni K\u014dkiri office:https://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/whakapa-mai",

        "content": "Simplified vaccination assessment tool will be able to be used mid-December to help employers decide if they would require vaccination for different types of work. Workers covered by the My Vaccine Pass mandate need to have their first dose by 3 December and be fully vaccinated by 17 January 2022. The Government is building on measures to protect businesses and workers from COVID-19as the country gets ready to transition to the new COVID-19 Protection Framework on December 3, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced today. \u201cEmployers and employees have been asking for certainty on what roles may need to be done by vaccinated workers under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, \u201d Michael Wood said. \u201cVaccine requirements in the workplace are a common tool many countries around the world are using to stop the spread of COVID and to protect their workers and customers from the virus. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a tool to help clarify what work should be covered by vaccinated workers which is simple and clear for assessing when it is reasonable to require vaccination for other work. \u201cThis tool provides a clear, legal framework to help businesses make decisions about vaccinations in the workplace. It builds on the guidance provided by WorkSafe and has had input from BusinessNZ and the CTU. The tool will specify four key factors, at least three of which must be met, before it would be reasonable to require vaccination for particular work. \u201cThis new process won\u2019t override risk assessments that businesses have already done under the existing health and safety guidelines. Businesses can choose which one they use, and any assessments done to date remain valid. \u201cWe understand that businesses and workers need certainty. Legislation allowing the vaccination assessment tool to be created, as well as introducing four weeks\u2019 paid notice of termination and paid time off to get vaccinated, will be passed under urgency this week. This legislation will come into effect the day after it is passed. The assessment tool will then be available for businesses to use once regulations are made in mid-December under the amended law. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense to ensure staff in workplaces that are either required to or can use the My Vaccine Pass are vaccinated. This is regardless of whether the business chooses to require My Vaccine Passes from customers or attendees. It gives confidence to the customers who are vaccinated and means the business will be less likely to be affected by cases. \u201cWe have tested this requirement with stakeholders, and it has received broad support, including from religious communities. Everyone wants to keep their staff, customers and congregations safe. \u201cThis requirement to be vaccinated applies to hospitality, events, close contact businesses and gyms. To continue doing work in these areas, workers will need to have their first vaccination by the day that the COVID-19 Protection Framework comes into effect, which will be Friday December 3. These workers will need to be fully vaccinated by 17 January 2022 to continue doing that work. \u201c91 per cent of New Zealanders have already had one dose of the vaccine, so for the overwhelming majority this requirement isn\u2019t an issue. For those who are not yet vaccinated, especially workers in areas where My Vaccine Passes can be applied, there are 10 days left to get your first dose. It is free, safe and the most effective way to keep you, your wh\u0101nau, business and customers safe. It\u2019s a simple contribution to keeping all New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, \u201d Michael Wood said.",

Following the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption and tsunami, New Zealand has provided $3 million to Tonga in humanitarian funding. A Royal New Zealand Air\u00a0Force C-130 Hercules\u00a0has departed Base Auckland Whenuapai earlier today carrying the vaccines, rapid antigen tests, and equipment to support re-establishing the electrical network. This donation brings New Zealand\u2019s total vaccine donations to over 47,000 for Tonga and 94,000 for Samoa.",

        "content": "From tomorrow, young people aged 16 and 17 can receive a free booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine at least six months after completing their primary course, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins has announced. This follows Medsafe\u2019s provisional approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) as a booster dose for this age group. \u201cThis decision is great news and means that from tomorrow, around 36,000 rangatahi aged 16 and 17 years will be eligible to receive a booster dose, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThey can do this by visiting any walk-in vaccination clinic around the country. \u201cA booster dose is particularly recommended for 16- and 17-year-olds who\u2019re at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalisation. \u00a0 This includes those who\u2019re immunocompromised or living with a family member who is immunocompromised, and M\u0101ori and Pacific rangatahi. \u201cDecisions like this are another important step in helping us protect all New Zealanders, especially as we get closer to the winter months. \u201cWe know that over time, immunity to the virus wanes, so getting the booster gives the best protection against COVID-19. \u201cThis is also a reminder to any New Zealander who hasn\u2019t yet had their booster, that even if you\u2019ve already had COVID-19, getting a booster at least 3 months after you test positive helps reduce the risk of being re-infected and passing it on to others. \u201cIt also reduces the chances of you becoming very ill and ending up in hospital. \u201cThis decision on booster doses for our young people protects more New Zealanders from the risk of serious complications from COVID-19. \u201cI also want to recognise theteam at Medsafe who\u2019ve worked hard to assess all COVID-19 vaccine applications. \u201cMedsafe follows a robust approval process to ensure all the vaccines we use in New Zealand meet acceptable standards for safety, quality and efficacy. \u201dNotes:You can check when you are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzIf your second dose was six months ago you can get your booster by:finding a walk-in vaccination centre atBookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). From 14 April, to allow time for technical integration of the decision into the digital booking system, this group will be able to book throughBookMyVaccine.nz. From14 April, you\u2019ll also be able to book for yourself or make a wh\u0101nau booking (group bookings for more than one person) by calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Interpretation services, and text, email and NZ Relay options for deaf and hearing impaired are available if you need them on 0800 28 29 26\u00a0(8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). There is also a specialist team for disabled people (option 2 on the 0800 number).",

        "content": "The Government has guaranteed that every New Zealander will have access to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, after securing an additional 8.5 million doses, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today. \u201cThe Government has signed an advance purchase agreement for 8.5 million additional doses, enough to vaccinate 4.25 million people. The vaccines are expected to arrive in New Zealand during the second half of the year, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThis brings our total Pfizer order to 10 million doses or enough for 5 million people to get the two shots needed to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. \u201dThe Government\u2019s original agreement with Pfizer was for approximately 1.5 million doses, enough to vaccinate 750,000 people. \u201cThe decision to make Pfizer New Zealand\u2019s primary vaccine provider, was based on the fact the Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be about 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection. \u201cIt also means all New Zealanders will have the chance to access the same vaccine. \u201cWhilst the Pfizer vaccine does need to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, this challenge is offset by only having to deal with one vaccine, rather than multiple vaccines with multiple protocols. It will simplify our vaccine roll out. \u201cThis purchase marks a significant milestone in New Zealand\u2019s fight against COVID-19. We can take heart that we\u2019ve now secured one of the strongest and more effective tools in the COVID-19 toolkit. \u201cWith every person who gets vaccinated, New Zealand gets one step closer to moving away from restrictions to manage COVID-19, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cThis is a significant addition to our COVID-19 vaccine portfolio. It indicates our confidence in the vaccine\u2019s performance to date and our demonstrated ability to administer it, \u201d COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe Ministry of Health is now working with Pfizer on a delivery schedule for the additional vaccines which will ensure a smooth rollout and a scaling up of our vaccination programme as we start to immunise the general public from the middle of the year. \u201cConsideration is also being given to how best to use vaccine doses that don\u2019t end up being needed in New Zealand. We are working on options for donating surplus doses across our wider portfolio to the Pacific and developing countries worldwide. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that any doses not needed here are put to good use elsewhere. Options could include delaying delivery to New Zealand, in order to free up supply for other countries in the short-term, or donating spare vaccines to other countries. \u201cWe are also working closely with the Realm countries of Niue, Tokelau, and the Cook Islands, as well as our close neighbours Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu to provide access to our vaccine portfolio and provide wider support for vaccine roll-out, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "For the more than 3.4 million eligible people already fully vaccinated, now is the time to get ready for a Kiwi summer by getting their My Vaccine Pass, Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said. My Vaccine Pass is an official record of a person\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination status and will provide access to places within New Zealand that require proof of vaccination under the new COVID-19 Protection Framework. \u201cWe\u2019re asking fully vaccinated New Zealanders to get ready for summer by requesting their pass, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cIt is your official proof of vaccination and a ticket to enjoy the extra freedoms that will come with the COVID-19 Protection Framework. To get one, people willneed to be fully vaccinated or be one of the very small number of Kiwis who has received a medical exemption. \u201cThe pass will be issued by the Ministry of Health. People can log onto My COVID Record to make a request for the free pass or call 0800 222 478. \u201cPeople can log in from later this morning, but we\u2019re asking for patience and for people to wait for a couple of days to ease any demand on the IT system and call centre staff. \u201cThe pass will mean people will be able to do the things they love, like going to concerts and music festivals, nights out at bars and restaurants, and going to the gym and sports events. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to miss out, so we\u2019re strongly encouraging those who\u2019ve been putting off getting a vaccine to take that step now, as we prepare to transition into the COVID-19 Protection Framework. \u201cThe Ministry of Health has worked closely with businesses and events companies to ensure they have the technology solutions needed to verify the pass \u2013 whichwill become part of people\u2019s daily routine, like carrying a drivers licence, scanning in at the supermarket or wearing a mask. \u201cMy Vaccine Pass has a QR code that can be scanned upon arrival at a venue. The pass can be downloaded to your personal phone and stored in your Apple or Google Wallet, or may be printed out. \u201cA separate International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate, which provides proof of your vaccination status in order to enter overseas countries, can also be requested if you need one. \u201cProof of a booster shot is not required at this stage to be able to access the pass, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Recognition of overseas vaccinations\u201cA process has been put in place for people who have had their COVID-19 vaccinations overseas to have these recognised here and submit an application for My Vaccine Pass. \u201cThe application process for this may take up to 14 days as details will initially be manually entered into the COVID-19 Immunisation Register. People are advised to prepare all their vaccine evidence from overseas and get their applications in as soon as possible from tomorrow. \u201dQ and AHow do I get My Vaccine Pass?Once\u00a0you\u00a0are fully vaccinated, \u00a0sign up to My Covid\u00a0Record\u00a0-www.mycovidrecord.nzto\u00a0see\u00a0your vaccination status\u00a0and request a pass. Your My Vaccine Pass will include your name, date of birth and a QR code. You can save this pass on a digital device, like your phone, or print a physical copy.

Where will people need to use My Vaccine Pass?Under the COVID Protection Framework you will be required to show My Vaccine Pass as proof of\u00a0vaccination status in a range of public settings such as events, hospitality, retail (opt in, except for essential services \u2013 see next Q and A), community, sport, and faith-based gatherings. Where do you not need to show a My Vaccine Pass?Under the COVID Protection Framework, there are certain settings where denying entry on the basis of vaccination status will be prohibited. You do not have to show proof of your vaccination status to accesssupermarkets, pharmacies, all health and disability services, food banks\u00a0or\u00a0petrol stations. Proof of vaccination is also not required in education settings, on all public transport (other than air travel), accessing housing and housing support services under state sector agencies. For children under the age of\u00a012, there is no requirement to show proof of vaccination. Is there anyone who is unable to get a My Vaccine Pass?There are very few people that are unable to get a vaccine due to medical grounds. \u00a0These people who apply through the Ministry of health and receive a temporary\u00a0medical\u00a0exemption process\u00a0will also be able to receive a vaccine pass. For children under the age of\u00a012, there is no requirement to show proof of vaccination. When will booster shots be included into the systems?People will be able to book a booster shot throughBook My Vaccinefrom 26 Nov. Once they\u2019ve had a booster shot, it will show up in theirMy COVID Recordalong with their other dosesThe date for a booster shot to be included as criteria forMy Vaccine Passas part of the definition of \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d is to be determined, requiring further advice from CVTAG. How long is My Vaccine Pass valid for?A person\u2019s My Vaccine Pass is valid for6 months from date of issue. This is because booster shots may be required to ensure ongoing protection against Covid, and because Medical Exemptions are only valid for 6 months. \u00a0If\u00a0vaccination passes are still required\u00a0after\u00a0a pass has expired, \u00a0you will need to request another one\u00a0to prove your vaccinations are current. How do I get My Vaccine Pass?Once\u00a0you\u00a0are fully vaccinated, \u00a0sign up to My Covid\u00a0Record\u00a0-www.mycovidrecord.nzto\u00a0see\u00a0your vaccination status\u00a0and request a pass. Your My Vaccine Pass will include your name, date of birth and a QR code. You can save this pass on a digital device, like your phone, or print a physical copy.

They need to have a National Health Index (NHI) ready or if may be asked a few things to confirm your identity \u2013 such as name and date of birth.

How will they access My Vaccine Pass?As of this week, 12 year olds and over can now access My COVID Record using my Health Account. What do people do who share an email within their household?An individual email is required when requesting a My Vaccine Pass via My COVID Record because people have different dates of birth, different medical records. This is common practice with digital services. For people who do not have an individual email account, they can register for their own unique email address from one of the free providers such as Gmail or Hotmail. Alternatively, a person can call the 0800 number and request a MVP which will then be mailed in hard copy to their address. How are\u00a0you looking after my privacy?The vaccination certificates are created from data held in the Covid Immunisation Register that records\u202fyour\u202fCOVID-19 vaccinations. \u202fThe vaccination certificate system has been designed to keep\u202fyour\u202fdetails private\u202fwith\u202fvaccination proof securely coded into the QR code. Why do you show my age on the pass?Some\u00a0businesses and organisations\u00a0might require that ID is shown along with your vaccination pass. \u00a0This is an important\u00a0method\u00a0to reduce vaccination pass forgery. How does someone get a My Vaccine Pass if they don't have one of the six forms of ID needed to sign up for My Covid Record?If someone has been vaccinated but doesn\u2019t have an ID, they can call 0800 222 478 to request a My Vaccine Pass. We suggest that they have their National Health Index (NHI) number ready, but if they don\u2019t have it, we may ask a few questions to confirm your identity \u2013 such as your name and date of birth. Can people coming from overseas get a My Vaccine Pass?A\u00a0process\u00a0is being established\u00a0to record\u00a0COVID vaccinations administered overseas\u00a0in the New Zealand Covid Immunisation Register. \u00a0We can record all\u00a023 vaccines that are approved\u00a0as per the New Zealand\u00a0entry\u00a0requirements. You\u00a0must apply for this information to be included in your records, \u00a0this will take up to 14 days\u00a0and people will need to provide proof of the vaccines and\u00a0dates administered\u00a0so they can be entered into the\u00a0COVID-19 Immunisation Register. While all 23 vaccines\u00a0can be recorded, these do not mean that you will be eligible for the My Vaccine Pass. \u00a0At this stage, \u00a0from\u00a0the week of\u00a026\u00a0November, \u00a0there are 8 approved vaccines\u00a0that can be\u00a0used as proof of vaccine status when applying for\u00a0My Vaccine Pass. They are:Pfizer/BioNTechJanssen (Johnson and Johnson)AstraZeneca (Oxford)AstraZeneca/Covishield\u00a0(Serum Institute of India)ModernaSinopharmSinovac\u00a0(CoronaVac)Covaxin\u00a0(Bharat Biotech)Do I need a\u00a0National Health Index\u00a0number to enter\u00a0My Covid\u00a0Record and request My Vaccine Pass?You\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0need\u00a0your\u00a0National Health Index (NHI)\u00a0number to log onto My\u00a0Covid\u00a0Record, \u00a0but you will\u00a0need an email address and a valid identity document, such as a birth certificate, drivers licence or passport\u00a0issued in New Zealand or Australia. You\u00a0can\u00a0call 0800 222 478\u00a0to request a My Vaccine Pass. Please have your National Health Index (NHI) ready or if you don\u2019t have it, \u00a0we\u00a0may need to\u00a0ask you a few things to\u00a0confirm your identity \u2013 such as your name and date of birth. For\u00a0overseas arrivals: currently those coming into the country do get issued with an NHI on arrival as they go into our MIQ system. How long will\u00a0I\u00a0need an\u00a0official\u00a0record of my vaccination status?As part\u00a0of\u00a0the CPF, you\u00a0will\u00a0need\u00a0proof\u00a0of\u00a0your\u00a0vaccination\u00a0status\u00a0to access public settings\u00a0in New Zealand\u00a0until further notice. This\u00a0is to\u00a0help ensure we are reducingthe risk of the virus spreading at large gatherings and events over the\u00a0summer\u00a0and into next year. It\u2019s anticipated that the need for proof of\u00a0a\u00a0vaccine certification when travelling internationally will be in place for years to come. International vaccine certificates\u00a0Q&AsWhen will\u00a0international\u00a0vaccine certificates\u00a0be\u00a0available?International vaccine certificates can be requested now. \u00a0If you\u00a0are using the call centre, it\u2019s\u00a0recommended you\u00a0request\u00a0a\u00a0certificate a\u00a0week or so\u00a0before\u00a0the date\u00a0you\u00a0intend\u00a0to travel overseas. The certificates\u00a0have an expiry date of one year. \u00a0You should sign up for My Covid Record now to ensure you\u00a0can create certificates\u00a0and\u00a0are ready to go. How can I know that the international certificate will be accepted by my country of destination?You should check the requirements of the country you\u2019re travelling to and find out what proof of vaccination, if any, is needed. You will need to follow all the usual immigration processes and additional steps, such as pre-departure COVID-19 testing.

        "content": "Securing the recovery and investing in the wellbeing of New Zealanders is the focus of Budget 2021, Grant Robertson told his audience at a pre-budget speech in Auckland this morning. \"The economy has proven resilient in response to COVID-19, due to people having confidence in the Government\u2019s health response to keep them safe. \u00a0 Unemployment has continued to trend down, an extra 32,000 jobs have been created in the six months to March and business and consumer confidence is increasing as our vaccine rollout is ramping up and we are carefully opening up our borders. \u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t take the recovery for granted. Further waves of COVID-19 around the world underline that we are still in a highly volatile and uncertain global environment. \u00a0 There are still sectors and regions in New Zealand struggling to deal with the impacts of the pandemic. We have also taken on considerable debt to support New Zealanders lives and livelihoods through COVID-19. \u201cIn this environment a balanced approached is required. We need to continue to be careful with our management of the economy, while also providing stimulus to accelerate the recovery and to make investments where they are needed the most to tackle our long term challenges in priority areas such as climate change, child wellbeing and housing. \u201cOur better than expected economic recovery does provide us with more options. There is a bit more space in our operating and capital allowances to support the economy in line with our wellbeing approach while also providing further scope to keep a lid on our higher debt levels and then lower it once the recovery is secure. \u201cAn investment-focused recovery that supports all New Zealanders is the way to ensure that our finances remain sustainable. It is also the way in which the Government will continue to tackle the long-standing issues that we were elected to address. \u201cIt is important to recognise that it can\u2019t all be done in one budget. I view this budget as one of a package of three this term to advance our priorities and return our books to a sustainable fiscal position, \u201d Grant Robertson said.",

While My Vaccine Pass is not legally required, people are encouraged to have their pass for when it might be needed, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Updated My Vaccine Passes will be available for anyone aged 12 and over who is up to date with their vaccinations for their age group and for the type of vaccine they have received, and this includes boosters for those over 18. \u201cIn early April 2022 the legal requirement for businesses to use My Vaccine Passes was removed. Some businesses may be voluntarily keeping My Vaccine Pass requirements as a condition of entry. \u201cFor this reason, it is a good idea to have an up-to-date My Vaccine Pass handy in case you are asked for it. I encourage everyone to stay up-to-date with their vaccinations and download their updated pass as it\u2019s an important record of their vaccination status. \u201cWe\u2019ve learnt over the last couple of years there are no certainties with COVID-19 and with new variants circling the globe, it\u2019s best we\u2019re prepared for every eventuality, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. An updated My Vaccine Passes will have an expiry date six months from the date of issue. The pass can be requested at any time provided people continue to be up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations. The updated My Vaccine Pass will have a slightly different look to the current version and a refreshed design, but it will still have a QR code.

The new freezers arrived in New Zealand on 27 May. They\u2019re currently being tested and accredited and will be ready for use by the end of this month. \u201cThis is the next step in getting the country ready to deliver 50,000 vaccinations a day at the peak of our vaccination campaign, \u201d Chris Hipkins says. \u201cFive of the new freezers have arrived in Christchurch, adding to the two already there, to ensure we have a second hub with capacity to deliver vaccines across the South Island and lower North Island. \u201cThe 12 remaining ultra-low temperature freezers will be based in Auckland, bringing the total number to 26 freezers \u2013 23 operating and three as back-up \u2013 across New Zealand. \u201cThis will be enough storage for four million doses at any one time. \u201dHaving two vaccination hubs and back-up freezers prepares New Zealand for any potential risks, such as earthquakes or other major disruptions to the roll-out. \u201cThis is the largest and most complex exercise the health system in New Zealand has ever undertaken and we want to ensure we are prepared for anything. \u201dAll shipments of the Pfizer vaccine currently go to Auckland, but as larger shipments start to arrive they will be flown direct to both Auckland and Christchurch for packing and distribution. The freezers cost up to $20,000 each.",

        "content": "The Government is providing a $1.5 million dollar boost to the Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund. This will directly support Pacific community-led initiatives to encourage boosters and child vaccinations, said the Associate Minister of Health Aupito William Sio. \u201cThe vaccine plays an important part in our preparations for Omicron. We need to ensure our 5\u201311-year-old Pacific children are vaccinated and that all of our eligible Pacific peoples get their booster when they become due. It\u2019s critical that we vaccinate our children before the coming winter . \u201cWe\u2019ve seen overseas how fast Omicron can overwhelm health care systems and impact essential services. Vaccination is the first step our families can take to prepare for Omicron. \u201cThe Pacific community\u2019s response to vaccinations has been excellent. National vaccination figures show that 97 percent have received their first dose, and 94 percent are fully vaccinated with two doses. \u201cHowever, data for booster uptake shows Pacific rates are still low in comparison with other communities in Aotearoa. Only 32 percent of Pacific people due for a booster have received one so far compared to 42 percent of M\u0101ori. \u201cIt\u2019s important our Pacific communities continue with their great response to vaccinations. This top up of the Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund will ensure our communities have the resources to achieve the high vaccination rates we need to keep safe, \u201d said Aupito William Sio. Pacific community groups predominantly in T\u0101maki Makauraucan apply for funding although groups from around Aotearoa are welcome to apply. Community groups, Pacific churches, Pacific youth groups and other groups that work with marginalised Pacific communities will be eligible to apply for up to $40,000. The Prepare Pacific Community Vaccination Fund, which is being managed by The Cause Collective, will run until 30 June 2022 or when funds have been fully distributed. \u201cThrough this fund we are asking our Pacific communities to prepare for Omicron by getting your booster and vaccinating our young children. Omicron will challenge all of us, we will need to be ready in advance. We\u2019ve met the challenge many times before, we must meet it again, \u201d said Aupito William Sio.

The advice, commissioned by Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall, suggests a phased re-opening of New Zealand\u2019s border once the vaccination programme is fully rolled out, and sets out the preparatory work needed now. \u201cThe emergence of the Delta variant has altered both the advice provided and our approach to reconnecting with the world, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cWe need to do more to further strengthen our borders and bolster our health defences, including through the vaccine rollout, before we can safely open the border further, and that will take a little more time to properly prepare. \u201cAchieving high rates of vaccination is critical to provide protection for individuals from being infected and becoming seriously ill. It will support a safe re-opening of New Zealand\u2019s borders by protecting wh\u0101nau and the wider community, by making it less likely that the virus will spread, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cThe Group recommends a phased approach to slowly admitting more travellers to New Zealand, without needing to go into MIQ, based on risk based factors such as their vaccination status and the state of the pandemic in their country of origin, \u201d Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe Group proposes these travellers would still be subject to a number of requirements, such as proof of vaccination, pre-departure testing and rapid testing on arrival in New Zealand. \u201cThe Group recommends preparatory work begins now, including seeking advice on rapid testing at airports, along with a strengthening of public health and social measures, such as expanding health system capability and contact tracing capacity, and mandating QR scanning at some types of venues - of which work is already underway by the Government, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. The advice also confirms the viability of maintaining our Elimination Strategy as international travel resumes. \u201cThe Elimination Strategy, defined as a zero tolerance to new cases, has served us incredibly well in keeping cases of Covid-19 out of the community and stamping out cases when they do arise, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. \u201cThe advice confirms that maintaining the Elimination Strategy does not mean our border settings must remain as they are. \u201cProvided that a high level of vaccination coverage is achieved, reliance on population-wide measures such as lockdowns can be reduced and the Elimination Strategy maintained through more targeted public health measures, such as testing and contact tracing. \u201cAccording to the advice, continuing with our Elimination Strategy is not only viable, but optimal, as we re-open borders, and will be key to protecting New Zealanders and maintaining our future options, \u201d Ayesha Verrall said. The Group, chaired by Sir David Skegg, is made up of experts in epidemiology, infectious diseases and public health, and has provided independent advice on our ongoing COVID-19 response.

        "content": "First batch of the 60,000 courses of Paxlovid coming this year has arrived and will be used from next week. Pharmac secures access to preventative COVID treatment Evusheld. New Zealand is boosting its comprehensive suite of medicines to treat COVID-19 with the arrival in the country of one medication, Paxlovid, and the securing of access to the country\u2019s first pre-exposure prophylactic treatment, Health Minister Andrew Little has announced. \u201cTwo years ago, at the start of the pandemic, we had no vaccines or medicines to specifically treat COVID-19 or prevent it spreading, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cNow, we have four vaccines and 95 per cent of eligible people are vaccinated. And we\u2019ve got four medicines being used in hospitals now to treat people who need it \u2013 Baricitinib, Ronapreve, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. \u201cFrom next week we\u2019ll be adding Paxlovid to the mix \u2013 pills that people with mild cases who are at the highest risk of becoming seriously unwell can take at home. \u201cThe first shipment of Paxlovid has arrived in New Zealand ahead of schedule and will start being offered to those most at risk from next week, protecting people from getting seriously ill and the health system from being overwhelmed. \u201cAccess to Paxlovid will be tight to make sure it gets to the people who need it most. It will be prescribed by doctors, with factors such as age, disability and being immuno-compromised taken into account. \u201dPharmac, the national medicines-funding agency, has also secured access to another medicine, Molnupiravir, which is awaiting Medsafe approval. \u201cThat\u2019s six medicines, and I am very pleased with the news today that Pharmac has secured access to a seventh, AstraZeneca\u2019s Evusheld, which can prevent people who can\u2019t have vaccines from getting COVID-19, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cEvusheld is a pre-exposure prophylactic treatment that can actually stop people developing COVID-19, and, if approved by Medsafe, will be an invaluable tool to protect people who can\u2019t have vaccines. \u201cIt means we will have medicines to treat those who need it, from before an infection sets in right through to cases of severe infection. It\u2019s a remarkable achievement in two years, and part of our plan to keep New Zealanders safe as we head into winter. \u201cThe emergence of highly effective vaccines and medicines means we can better manage COVID-19 while reopening our borders and easing restrictions. They mean we can shift our focus towards recovery more secure in the knowledge we have a highly vaccinated population and those most at risk of the virus will also have medicines to help protect them. \u201dFunding for all COVID medicines comes from the Government\u2019s COVID-19 fund. Editors\u2019 notes:How is Evusheld different from a vaccine?Vaccination uses a person\u2019s immune system to create antibodies that provide protection against infectious diseases such as COVID-19. \u00a0 Monoclonal antibody treatments such as Evusheld allow antibodies that provide protection against COVID-19 to be given directly to a patient and does not require a patient\u2019s immune system to create these antibodies. \u00a0 This means Evusheld is a particularly useful treatment for people who are immunocompromised and would not be able to generate antibodies in response to vaccination against COVID-19. Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination against COVID-19 but it does provide an option for the small group of people who are not able to be vaccinatedMore information about New Zealand\u2019s COVID medicines can be found onPharmac's website.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern today attended the ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit and discussed with Leaders a range of shared challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region, including:The ongoing management of the COVID-19 pandemic;The importance of working collectively to accelerate economic recovery; andExploring further opportunities for partners to work more closely on health, economic and security issues facing the region. The ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit, which was held digitally, also marked the 45th anniversary of the diplomatic partnership between the two parties. \u201cNew Zealand and ASEAN share a strong legacy of working together to advance peace and prosperity in our region. ASEAN is our fourth largest trading partner, a crucial defence and security partner, and a critical strategic hub that connects us to Asia and the rest of the world, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cOur partnership will play an important role as our countries work together to support global efforts to manage the pandemic and ensure fair and equitable access to safe vaccines, and drive economic recovery through maintaining open markets for our exporters and resilient supply chains, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. The Prime Minister, through a joint statement with Leaders, reaffirmed New Zealand\u2019s commitment to strengthening its partnership with ASEAN under the themes of \u201cPeace, Prosperity, People and Planet\u201d, which will promote cooperation in areas such as sustainability and climate change, trade facilitation and digital commerce. Later tonight the Prime Minister will also digitally attend the East Asia Summit (EAS), the region\u2019s premier forum for leaders to discuss pressing strategic issues facing our region. \u201cThe meeting will be a good chance to exchange views with other leaders on the pandemic and issues such as the South China Sea and climate change, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Note to editors:The Joint Statement released by the Prime Ministers at the ASEAN-New Zealand CommemorativeSummit is included below. The ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit is a five-yearly meeting between Heads of State/Government of ASEAN and New Zealand. The ASEAN has 10\u00a0members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam). Established in 2005, the East Asia Summit is now the premier Leaders political and security forum in the Indo-Pacific. Leaders meet annually and discuss issues and emerging challenges that concern them the most. The East Asia Summit comprises ASEAN plus eight dialogue partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, US). Joint ASEAN-New Zealand Leaders\u2019 Vision Statement on the 45thAnniversary of ASEAN-New Zealand Dialogue Relations:A Legacy of Partnership, A Future Together1. We, the Heads of State/Government of the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and New Zealand, met via videoconference on 14 November 2020, under Viet Nam\u2019s 2020 ASEAN Chairmanship, to commemorate the 45thAnniversary of ASEAN-New Zealand Dialogue Relations.2. The ASEAN-New Zealand Leaders\u2019 Commemorative Summit marks an important milestone in the ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership, as both sides share a strong legacy, and have achieved much over the past 45 years across a wide range of areas, including political, security, trade and economic, people-to-people, and development cooperation.3. We reaffirm our mutual respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality, and independence, as espoused in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC), and reiterate our determination to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for international law.4. We share deep concern over the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the lives of people as well as economies around the world. Our thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones or who are suffering from the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. We recognise the heroic efforts of medical professionals, healthcare workers, and other front-liners around the world, and dedicate ourselves to close partnership in pursuit of recovery.5. We acknowledge the progress achieved in the full implementation of the Plan of Action to Implement the Joint Statement for ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership (2016\u2013 2020), and its two key strategies, namely the \u201cPeople Strategy\u201d and the \u201cProsperity Strategy\u201d, which have enhanced cooperation and contributed towards the realisation of the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and its Blueprints.6. As we look to the future, we underscore the importance of the ASEAN-New Zealand strategic partnership, and the principle of genuine, mutually-beneficial cooperation that has underpinned our dialogue relations for the past 45 years. In this context, we reaffirm our commitment to upholding a stable, rules-based international order; maintaining an open and inclusive region where people enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms; reinforcing the multilateral trading system through deeper and more ambitious economic integration; and building on the region\u2019s sustainable development agenda with an emphasis on environmental resilience and collective action which addresses climate change. To this end, we will redouble our collective efforts to achieve the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 \u2013 a year which will mark New Zealand\u2019s fiftieth anniversary of dialogue partnership with ASEAN.7. Consequently, we welcome efforts toward the realization of the Plan of Action to Implement the ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership (2021-2025), focusing cooperation under the four key themes of \u201cPeace, Prosperity, People, and Planet\u201d, which are in line with the three pillars of ASEAN Community, namely Political-SecurityCommunity, Economic Community, and Socio-Cultural Community, to reflect ASEAN and New Zealand\u2019s ambition to strengthen and deepen our Strategic Partnership. PEACE8. We reaffirm our shared commitment to maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes. We further reaffirm our dedication to an open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based regional architecture, which respects the sovereignty of all states regardless of their size; which is based on key principles such as adherence to international law and open markets; and which is built on ASEAN-led mechanisms. We therefore reiterate our determination to promote shared values and norms including those enshrined in the ASEAN Charter, the Charter of the United Nations, and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.9. In recognition of the vital role of regional and multilateral institutions, we therefore reiterate the importance of regular and comprehensive ASEAN-New Zealand dialogue and cooperation, as well as engagement in ASEAN-led frameworks such as the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus). We reaffirm our interest in exploring possible cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and New Zealand\u2019s priorities for the Indo-Pacific, in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace, freedom, and prosperity in the region and beyond.10. In light of our shared goal of regional peace and stability, we will continue to work together on confidence-building and preventive diplomacy, including through the ASEAN Regional Forum process, and to address regional security challenges, including through cooperation to promote cybersecurity, combat transnational organised crime and cybercrime, strengthen border security, counter terrorism, and promote social inclusiveness to prevent violent extremism. We recognise New Zealand\u2019s long-standing support to demining activities in the region, including through regional mechanisms. We also welcome opportunities to share expertise and build capacity of defence officials.11. We reaffirm our mutual dedication to disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and in light of its fiftieth anniversary, we recognise the instrumental role of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in supporting international efforts to curtail the threats posed by nuclear weapons and their proliferation. In this context, we note the opportunities for cooperation between ASEAN and New Zealand on the South East Asia Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone (SEANWFZ) and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone.12. We reiterate the importance of promoting maritime security and safety, freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded commerce, mutual trust and confidence, the exercise of self-restraint, the non-use of force or of the threat to use force, and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and compliance with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization and relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization. PROSPERITY13. We note the strong trade and business links between ASEAN countries and New Zealand, with two-way trade between ASEAN and New Zealand growing by almost two-thirds in the past ten years. These links will stand us in good stead in mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic. We therefore affirm our determination to work together to advance regional economic integration, resist all forms of protectionism, and ensure resilient supply chains that facilitate the unimpeded flow of goods and services. As highly trade-oriented economies, we rededicate ourselves to supporting the rules-based multilateral trading system, which underpins our region\u2019s economic growth and sustainable development, and to ensuring that the WTO is forward-looking, reformed, and well-positioned to tackle 21stcentury trade challenges.14. We therefore welcome the decision to officially launch negotiations to upgrade the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement in early 2021, to ensure it remains a visionary and precedent-setting agreement, which delivers tangible benefits to our businesses, consumers, and peoples, and which demonstrates the genuine economic partnership between ASEAN and New Zealand. We also look forward to the signing and implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which will facilitate stronger trade and business ties, and support regional economic integration efforts.15. To this end, we will redouble our efforts to deepen practical economic cooperation, improve business linkages, and support human capital development in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, noting the importance of science, technology and innovation for 21stcentury economies. We therefore welcome New Zealand\u2019s interest in supporting ASEAN\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery efforts, taking into account the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, including through engagement to improve ease of doing business, enhance the region\u2019s digital transformation, and strengthen the resilience of supply chains. In support of these efforts, we encourage the early conclusion of a high-quality ASEAN-New Zealand regional Air Services Agreement, to provide a more open environment for air links and to facilitate greater ease of movement of people and goods, and look forward to the successor programme of the AANZFTA Economic Cooperation Support Programme. PEOPLE16. We welcome the understanding and friendships that have developed between the peoples of ASEAN and New Zealand, including as a result of our People-to-People programmes. With a view to building greater awareness of ASEAN-New Zealand relations, we endeavour to strengthen further those links through two-way exchanges, scholarships, and short-term specialist training programmes such as English language training, and technical vocational education and training, by promoting the diverse and rich culture in ASEAN Member States and New Zealand, and by exploring other opportunities for building capacity for economic and social development, with a particular focus on opportunities that build links between our youth, young leaders, and entrepreneurs.17. We reaffirm our efforts to promote good governance at all levels, and to realise vibrant and inclusive societies that promote high quality of life and equitable access to opportunities for all, whose members enjoy human rights, and which promote social protection for vulnerable groups.18. We acknowledge the on-going threat of communicable and emerging infectious diseases, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, and reaffirm the value in strengthening cooperation and sharing information to enable collective, coordinated and comprehensive responses to such events, which require a whole of government and whole of society approach. We express our support for global initiatives that ensure the fair and equitable global access to and distribution of safe, effective, and affordable COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, including but not limited to the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility and Advance Market Commitment; and underscore the importance of strong, resilient and sustainable supply chains, in order to effectively facilitate trade and to ensure the unimpeded flow of goods and services, including medical supplies, medicines and vaccines, food, commodities and other essential supplies and services in the region. We also welcome New Zealand\u2019s contribution to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund. PLANET19. We acknowledge that as political leaders we carry responsibility for the sustainable management, effective conservation, and responsible stewardship of our lands and forests, our environment, and our people. We therefore recognise the importance of working together to ensure a sustainable and climate-resilient economic recovery, as well as exploring support for initiatives which strengthen the region\u2019s capabilities on environmental protection, climate change and sustainability issues, including the implementation of the Paris Agreement; promote renewable energy, the sustainable management of natural resources, and the conservation of forests and biological diversity; combat marine plastic debris; and address Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing. In this regard, New Zealand highlighted the M\u0101ori concept of kaitiakitanga, which emphasises the importance of caring for and protecting peoples and places for future generations.20. We reiterate the importance of continuing to work together on disaster management to enhance disaster awareness and strengthen respective capabilities in disaster risk reduction, mitigation, prevention, preparedness and response, and recovery, including under the ambit of ASEAN-led mechanisms and initiatives.21. To give effect to this, we welcome New Zealand\u2019s efforts to promote climate-smart agriculture in ASEAN, with a focus on improving food security while addressing efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage officials working on climate change to strengthen engagement. We also welcome New Zealand\u2019s interest in promoting sustainable water management in the Mekong sub-region, including through its contribution to the Mekong River Commission. CROSS-PILLAR COOPERATION22. We underscore the importance of enhancing cross-pillar cooperation and the role that the seamless movement of people, goods and services plays in bringing the peoples of ASEAN and New Zealand closer together, as well as building strong links throughout the region, including with Pacific Island countries. In this regard, we will continue to work together in support of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) 2025, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan IV (2021-2025), and the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN).23. We will also redouble our efforts toward the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in our region, including through the promotion of complementarities between the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Complementarities Initiative).24. In support of all our work, we will continue our efforts to embed the principles of good governance, and to foster transparent, accountable, participatory and effective governance, throughout the region; including by strengthening the capacity of the ASEAN Secretariat and appropriate ASEAN entities. As we adopt this Joint Vision Statement, we reflect on the long history of genuine friendship between ASEAN and New Zealand, including New Zealand's contributions to the region as one of ASEAN's oldest dialogue partners. We therefore task our relevant officials to bear this spirit of partnership in mind as we implement and realise our vision identified in this Joint Statement and the Plan of Action 2021-2025, as well as other existing ASEAN-New Zealand frameworks for cooperation.",

        "content": "The Government is ramping up the flu vaccination campaign which starts today, with 40 per cent more flu shots available this year as part of the COVID-19 winter plan. New Zealand usually uses about 1.4 million flu vaccines a year. This year, the Government is making two million available and is widening eligibility for people to get vaccinated for free. \u201cWith the Omicron wave still working its way through the country, we need to protect our most vulnerable from getting the flu as well, and our health system from coming under more pressure, \u201d Health Minister Andrew Little said. \u201cWe already make the flu shot available for free for everyone over the age of 65, and for those who are pregnant or at risk of becoming seriously ill because of other underlying conditions. \u201cThis winter, on the advice of doctors, we\u2019re widening eligibility to include M\u0101ori and Pacific people aged 55 and over, which means an extra 39,000 people can have the vaccine for free. \u201dAndrew Little urged as many people as possible to get the vaccine. \u201cIn an ordinary year, flu kills more than 500 New Zealanders. And this is no ordinary year, \u201d he said. \u201cEvery year, about half the people eligible for free vaccination take it up. For the past two years, with the country closed to the rest of the world because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019ve been largely free of colds and flu. \u201cThat\u2019s changing, though, with our borders opening, and I encourage everyone \u2013 and especially the most vulnerable \u2013 to get vaccinated. Anyone who is part of Group Three for the COVID vaccination rollout should make sure they get a flu shot. \u201cThe programme is being rolled out across the country from today, with vaccinations available from family doctors, pharmacists and some M\u0101ori and Pacific health providers. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at ways to increase the vaccination workforce to get flu shots to those who need them. We have trained and authorised many new pharmacist vaccinators over the past two years, including provisional pharmacist vaccinators who are able to administer the influenza vaccine. \u201dThe $12 million expansion programme is being funded from the Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.",

        "title": "Workplace vaccination requirements extended to cover Police and NZ Defence Force",
        "content": "With the support of the organisations, additional vaccination requirements will cover sworn members, recruits and authorised officers of the New Zealand Police, and all New Zealand Defence Force staff. First doses of the vaccine for workers in these organisations are required by 17 January 2022, and second doses by 1 March 2022. These groups are added to the list of sectors covered by vaccination, which includes MIQ and border work, healthcare, education, and prisons. Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced today that workplace vaccination requirements will be extended to include the New Zealand Police and Defence Force in preparation for the transition to the new COVID-19 Protection Framework on 3 December 2021. Ministers have worked with Police and Defence Force leadership on this, and there is broad support for the decision. \u201cVaccination is our greatest tool in keeping New Zealanders safe, so we have extended vaccine requirements to include constabulary, recruits and authorised officers of New Zealand Police, and the armed forces and civilian staff of the New Zealand Defence Force, \u201d Michael Wood said. \u201cSo many of the individuals within these organisations have been essential to our COVID-19 response and are already fully vaccinated. But we want to ensure that those who serve and protect our communities on a daily basis can do so without unintentionally spreading the virus, \u201d Michael Wood said. First doses of vaccinations for workers in these organisations will be required by 17 January 2022, and second doses by 1 March 2022. \u201cWe already have a very high vaccination rate in the Police and it makes sense operationally to make it a requirement for the constabulary, recruits and authorised officers who have regular contact with members to be vaccinated. This is about keeping Police safe and the community safe. 92.2 per cent of all Constabulary Police staff have received at least one dose, and 86.5 per cent are now fully vaccinated. As they are often in contact with vulnerable communities, this is the best way that we can protect our Police staff and the public from COVID-19, \u201d Police Minister Poto Williams said. \u201cThe NZDF provide critical services to New Zealand, including assisting Police at regional borders, and supporting MBIE in resourcing MIQ facilities. It makes sense that they are included in the mandate and most of the NZDF\u2019s Regular Force are already vaccinated. Our defence forces can be deployed at any time to locations where they may come into contact with COVID-19. For example, the recent mission to Afghanistan saw our defence force personnel assisting in the evacuation of New Zealand visa holders, some of whom had COVID, \u201d Defence Minister Peeni Henare said. NZDF uniformed personnel are currently 98.4 per cent fully vaccinated and civilian staff are already 75 per cent fully vaccinated through the NZDF vaccination programme delivered earlier this year. These rates do not include those who may have received vaccinations through the public health system. \u201cWhile a number of other sectors have requested additional government vaccination requirements we are not progressing them at this time. Vaccine mandates are very strong legal requirements that have to be carefully considered based on a clear assessment about how justifiable they are, \u201cMichael Wood said. \u201cAn increasingly large proportion of the population is double-dosed with thousands more getting vaccinated every day, and the simple vaccination assessment tool that will be available for businesses in mid-December will help to streamline the process, \u201d Michael Wood said.",

        "content": "The Government is further strengthening the border against COVID-19 by making it mandatory for more of the workforce to be vaccinated, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins announced today. \u201cTo prevent the virus getting into our communities, we must continue to strengthen our border by protecting the people who work there, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. The new COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2021 comes into effect at 11:59pm on 14 July 2021. \u201cAs well as workers at Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) facilities, workers at our ports and airports who are at the greatest risk of exposure to COVID-19 must now be vaccinated, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe vaccination of MIQ workers has been successful so far. Latest numbers show there were 4,332 MIQ workers on site for the week ending 4 July, all of whom were vaccinated. No unvaccinated worker can enter an MIQ facility. \u201cOf the active air border workers, 82 percent are fully vaccinated and 2 percent have received a single dose and await their second. \u201cHowever only 54 percent of active port workers have been fully vaccinated, and we need to see this number increased to avoid the risk of COVID-19 entering the country via our ports. \u201cI am extending the mandatory order to cover a further 1800 currently unvaccinated active border workers. This is necessary to lift the uptake of the vaccine among the wider border workforce and strengthen our ongoing response to COVID-19. \u201cI\u2019d also encourage border employers to look at opportunities to make it easy for their workers to get vaccine appointments and to urge employees to get their vaccination. It is in their interests to keep COVID-19 out and their businesses open by having a vaccinated workforce. \u201dThe legislation allows for a reasonable window for vaccination. All government employees covered by the order must have had their first dose by 26 August, while privately employed border workers must have had their first dose by 30 September. New workers covered by the Order (regardless of employer) will need to have their first dose before starting work. \u201cBorder workers who remain unvaccinated after the requirements come into effect will need to discuss options with their employer. They will not be able to continue working in a high-risk border environment until they are vaccinated, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. The expanded Order applies to people working at:MIQFs and MIFs (previously covered)airside area of affected airports and some other higher-risk work at airportsaffected portsaccommodation services where specified aircrew members are self-isolating. It also includes work:that involves handling affected items removed from ships, aircraft or MIQFs or MIFs, ANDwhere the job is for a company that is routinely engaged to provide services for an aircraft, ship, MIQF or MIF, ANDwhere the employee \u2018has contact with\u2019 people who belong to different groups in the Order.",

        "content": "The goal of safely re-opening our borders and developing new ways for people to travel will start with a self-isolation pilot, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed today. \u201cAs part of the Reconnecting New Zealanders plan announced in August, the self-isolation pilot will look at self-isolation for vaccinated travellers who have not been to very high-risk countries, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe pilot is to explore a new pathway of entry into New Zealand and allows the Government to test operational readiness, identify areas where further work is required to scale up the approach and provide valuable insights into our options for the future. \u201cExpressions of Interest are being called for up to 150 people to participate in the pilot. \u201cThe pilot is aimed at business travellers, to travel overseas on a short business trip and self-isolate in approved accommodation for 14 days on their return. \u201cSelf-isolation must be in a private dwelling with no shared ventilation system. The dwelling must have cellular coverage. Monitoring and testing over the self-isolation period will be mandatory. \u201cParticipants are required to be a New Zealand citizen or holders of a resident visa with a right to re-enter New Zealand, be fully-vaccinated in New Zealand with the Pfizer vaccine, and not travel to or through very high-risk countries. Travel must be for business purposes which cannot be carried out from New Zealand. \u201cParticipants will be selected through an Expressions of Interest (EOI) process. \u00a0 Employers will need to apply on behalf of their employees and can submit their EOI from 9am, Thursday 30 September until 5pm, Saturday 9 October. \u201cBusinesses are encouraged to check the criteria carefully. As demand is expected to be higher than the numbers in the pilot, all eligible EOIs will be put into a ballot and spread across the six-week arrival timeframe. \u201cPublic safety and keeping COVID-19 out of the community still remains our top priority, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. Notes for editors:When in self-isolation, participants must:remain in their place of self-isolation for at least 14 days. They will not be allowed to leave the property at any timeisolate alone, or together with others from the same travelling party. They cannot isolate with family or any other household members.not allow any visitors to enter the premises, aside from medical staff for testing purposes and emergency or other essential services if required (e.g. fire, ambulance, police, tradespeople for urgent repairs);provide their own food and supplies (contactless deliveries are allowed)comply with all testing requirements set out by the Ministry of Health;comply with all monitoring requirements. More information on the self-isolation pilot will be made available in the next few days:www.miq.govt.nz",

As of this morning over 98% of the active border workforce have received at least one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and 93% are fully vaccinated. \u201cThis greater protection at our border gives us confidence that those people who are going to work and doing their jobs, aren\u2019t going to get sick or die from COVID-19 if we see another international ship present with the virus in our waters, or have an incursion at an airport or MIQ facility, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cIt also reduces the possibility of transmission on to others in the community. \u201cOver the past 10 weeks, vaccination rates for active border workers across all sectors have climbed. This is testament to the hard work of the air and maritime sectors, employers, unions, DHBs, resident experts and border workers themselves for their work in this space. \u201dTotal workers have climbed to 98% from just 84% having had one dose in July. For port workers, there has been a huge jump from just 55% in July, to 95% today. \u201cAll Government employed workers are now vaccinated, and this week\u2019s deadline brings private employers in as well. This is a significant step towards protecting New Zealanders from COVID-19 now and into the future. \u201cThis is increasingly important as we look to how we reopen to the world. The border will continue to be our first defence against COVID-19 and the people who work there must be protected. \u201cAnyone who has been uncertain about getting vaccinated has one more day to ask any outstanding questions and get that first dose. You will then have 35 days to get your second one following the deadline. \u201cI encourage you to do this. It will keep you safe. I am extremely pleased and relieved this order comes into effect this week, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

They\u2019ve stepped up across the country \u2013 and particularly in Auckland at our testing centres, vaccination clinics and hospitals \u2013 and are continuing to deliver incredible numbers which we can all be proud of. \u201cWith 2.75 million doses administered so far and 1.5 million active bookings in the Book My Vaccine system, we remain on track to give everyone eligible in Aotearoa the opportunity to be vaccinated by the end of the year. \u201cYesterday, around 36,500 people received their first vaccination, and more than 15,600 had their second vaccination. \u201cOn Friday, we also created a new priority group for essential workers, and since then more than 1,400 essential workers have had their first vaccination. \u201cThanks to everyone who has either had the vaccine or has made a booking to get vaccinated. \u201cYour response means we\u2019ve been able to open other age bands for vaccinations earlier than planned to keep the momentum going. \u201cReaching this 1 million milestone is also due to the hard work of our district health boards and primary care providers, who have continued to add to our capacity to vaccinate people each week, as well as the number of sites where people can be vaccinated. \u201cFigures from yesterday show there are now more than 500 general practices and pharmacies administering the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the country, with more coming on stream. \u201cBy getting vaccinated, people are protecting themselves, \u00a0theirwh\u0101nauand playing their part in protecting New Zealand. \u201d",

This is an awesome achievement and I want to thank everyone who took up this opportunity, \u201d Peeni Henare said. As of 11.59pm yesterday, 375,387 M\u0101ori have had at least one dose (66 per cent of the eligible M\u0101ori population) and 252,419 (44 per cent) are fully vaccinated. \u201cSuper Saturday\u2019s vaccination rate has shown the success of many wh\u0101nau-based programmes designed and delivered by M\u0101ori, for M\u0101ori, by people who M\u0101ori communities know and trust. \u201cHawke\u2019s Bay vaccinated over 6 percent of its entire eligible M\u0101ori population in a single day, which is an impressive feat and highlights the mahi that this community committed towards its Super Saturday effort. \u201cIt was great to see so many wh\u0101nau attending special events and enjoying the party atmosphere of Super Saturday. \u201cWe must now build on the collective mahi being led by M\u0101ori providers and communities across Aotearoa to ensure we are protected from the virus. We have a way to go to raise the vaccine uptake rate, but I know with our collective will, and by continuing our wh\u0101nau-centred approach, we can do this. \u201cThere is still a huge range of vaccination options available for M\u0101ori including pharmacies, GPs, mobile and pop-up clinics, mass vaccinations, workplace events and marae-based programmes. Drive-through vaccination sites where wh\u0101nau can be vaccinated in their cars together is also providing an accessible option for many disabled wh\u0101nau. \u201cAll of these initiatives are ensuring M\u0101ori can access services that meet their needs. We know this is critical to the vaccination uptake rate. \u201cSo, let\u2019s keep this massive effort going to keep our wh\u0101nau and Aotearoa safe by getting vaccinated, \u201d Peeni Henare said.",

        "content": "Two thirds of New Zealanders are now eligible for their booster, as new mask requirements come in to help keep people safe, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. \u201cIf you got your second vaccination at least three months ago, you can walk-in or book-in to get your booster from today, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThere is plenty of capacity to get vaccinated this weekend and throughout February, wherever you are in the country. \u201cThis is the best thing you can do to protect yourselves and your wh\u0101nau as we prepare for Omicron. Get boosted, and wear a mask when you can\u2019t distance from others. We will have a much better chance of facing the virus if we are well prepared. \u201dFrom 11:59pm last night (3 February) medical type masks became mandatory for those people who fall under a vaccine mandate and are in public-facing roles at work. For everyone else, masks are still mandatory on flights, public transport, in taxis, retail, public facilities, and in education for Year 4 and up. They should also now be worn at\u00a0close proximity businesses, food and drink businesses, at public events and gatherings. Masks can no longer be a t-shirt, bandana or scarf. It needs to cover your mouth and nose, and attach with ear or head loops. \u201cEnsuring you have the right mask, and that it is worn properly, will improve the overall effectiveness of wearing them and help reduce transmission of COVID-19, including Omicron, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cWe are now looking to the next stages of our response to COVID-19 and Reconnecting New Zealanders to the world. We are preparing for the virus in our communities by putting measures in place to tackle it head on. \u201cOur high vaccination rates and climbing booster rate is our best defence from getting very sick from the virus, while masks help us to reduce the likelihood of passing it on to others or picking it up. \u201cThese measures and continued good hygiene practices, alongside our phased plan to take on Omicron, will help keep our supply chains operating, economy ticking, people in work and kids in school. \u201dHow to get boosted:Everyone over 18 can check when they are due for a booster by visitingmycovidrecord.nzor if they have one, referring to their purple COVID-19 Vaccine appointment card or calling COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Book your booster or find a walk-in vaccination centre atbookmyvaccine.nzor call COVID Vaccination Healthline 0800 28 29 26 (8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). Wh\u0101nau bookings (group bookings for more than one person) can be made by calling 0800 28 29 26. COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be available at mobile and pop-up vaccination clinics, particularly in rural M\u0101ori communities as well as marae vaccinations where a number of kaumatua received their initial doses. Interpretation services, and text, email and NZ Relay options for deaf and hearing impaired are available if you need them on 0800 28 29 26\u00a0(8am - 8pm, 7 days a week). There is also a specialist team for disabled people (option 2 on the 0800 number). A reminder of the new mask rules:Workers who fall under a legal vaccine mandate and are in a public-facing role will be required to wear a medical-grade mask (Type IIR/Level 2 or above). Children in Year 4 and up will need to wear a mask on Ministry of Education funded school transport services and public transport, as well as in school. Teachers of students in years 4 to 13 are required to wear medical-grade masks, as above. Everyone else should wear masks in close-proximity businesses, food and drink businesses, at events and gatherings. You will still be able to remove your mask when eating and drinking. This must be an actual mask with ear or head loops that covers both the nose and mouth properly and fits against the face. That means no more scarves, bandanas, or t-shirts pulled up. Most gatherings where guests have exclusive use of a defined space won\u2019t require guests to wear amask, such as weddings. Workers(including volunteers) will continue to be required to wear a mask. People are not required to wear masks in non-public facing workplaces, but all employers should continue to think about mask use policies that protect their workforce. Masks are also not required when using gyms or swimming pools, however it is encouraged when moving around or in close proximity to others.",

The Crown accounts for the nine months to the end of March 2021 show both OBEGAL and the operating balance remain better than forecast in the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update (HYEFU) released in December last year. The operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) was $5.2 billion better than forecast in the HYEFU. Tax revenue was $69.9 billion, $4 billion above forecast due to higher than expected corporate and income tax, and GST revenue. Net core Crown debt was 33.3% of GDP, $6.6 billion less than forecast. \u201cThe economy\u2019s robustness and confidence in the recovery has meant the Crown\u2019s financial accounts are in better shape than expected. The Government\u2019s vaccine rollout and careful re-opening of the borders provides further confidence as we focus on accelerating the recovery, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cOur resilience, however, will continue to be tested. The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on India is a painful reminder that we are still in a volatile and uncertain global economic environment. Supply chain issues affect the economy. Some sectors and regions in New Zealand remain under pressure. \u201cWhile these results are strong, we do need to remember that we are still facing elevated levels of debt and OBEGAL deficits for some years to come as a result of the borrowing needed to support New Zealanders through COVID 19. \u201cBudget 2021 will reflect the economic conditions and revenue situation and take a balanced approach that continues to emphasise spending to areas and people where it is needed most alongside careful fiscal management. \u201cWe have used our strong balance sheet in response to COVID and will continue to invest to meet our three priorities of keeping New Zealanders safe, accelerating the recovery and address long standing issues of climate change, housing affordability and child wellbeing. We will do all this while working towards reducing our debt levels, \u201d Grant Robertson said.",

        "content": "Efforts to support disabled peoples\u2019 vaccinations go from strength-to-strength with the launch of a new text service, Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni announced today. The service, run by Whakarongorau Aotearoa on behalf of the Ministry of Health, is in response to feedback from the disability community and is an addition to the COVID Vaccination Healthline, which already offers dedicated phone and email support for disabled people and people living with impairments to get their COVID-19 vaccination. \u201cWe\u2019re making it easier for the deaf, hard of hearing community and others who may be speech impaired to get vaccinated. They can now text 8988 for access to vaccine information, help to book a vaccination appointment, or support with transport, \u201d Carmel Sepuloni said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to see good uptake of the phone and email service which has already received over 3,400 phone calls since September. It has not only been a safe haven for disabled people to discuss the vaccination, anxiety or needle phobias, but they\u2019ve been supported to access sites with low sensory settings for example as well as home vaccinations. \u201cThe Whakarongorau service is staffed with a dedicated team of advisors who are either living with a disability themselves, have close wh\u0101nau with a disability or, have extensive experience working with the disabled community. Their lived experience makes the service unique and underlines the ethos of The Manaakitanga Journey to enhancing the vaccination experiences for disabled people. \u201cOne in four New Zealanders identify as disabled or having an impairment. As of the 21st of November, of the 37,269 people supported by Disability Support Services and long term ACC clients nationwide, 86 percent have had their first dose, and 79 percent have been fully vaccinated. \u201cAs we take steps towards more freedoms as a fully vaccinated Aotearoa NZ, we\u2019re committed to ensuring that our vaccination programme continues to be as accessible and inclusive as possible to all New Zealanders. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new phase in our fight against COVID, and an even greater fight to protect the hauora of disabled people and their wh\u0101nau, \u201d Carmel Sepuloni said.

        "content": "Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern and Prime Minister the Hon Scott Morrison MP met in Queenstown on 31 May 2021 for the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders\u2019 Meeting.1. The Australia-New\u00a0Zealand relationship is unique in its closeness; we are partners and allies, and we share a relationship of family, of wh\u0101nau. Through our single economic market, our people-to-people ties and our shared interests in the region and the world, Australia and New\u00a0Zealand stand together.2. The Prime Ministers began by acknowledging the unique role of Australia\u2019s and New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s Indigenous peoples in the identity of both countries, including their rich cultures and languages, and their ancestral, spiritual and continuing connections to land, water and community. COVID-19 response and recovery3. The Prime Ministers were pleased to have their first in-person meeting since February last year, made possible by two-way quarantine-free travel across the Tasman.4. They welcomed close trans-Tasman cooperation in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and noted that quarantine-free travel was a reflection of how hard both countries have worked to manage COVID-19. They acknowledged the toll on those in both countries who had lost loved ones, and all those who had suffered economically. They expressed condolences to countries which had experienced a far greater impact, including those battling second, third or fourth waves.5. The Prime Ministers acknowledged trans-Tasman collaboration to support early COVID-19 vaccine development and purchase, including the ACT Accelerator and the COVAX Facility. They acknowledged the valuable contribution of COVAX in ensuring equitable access to vaccines, globally. They agreed to continue cooperation on vaccines, including research and development. The Prime Ministers undertook to support efforts to ensure the free international movement of medical goods, including vaccines and vaccine components.6. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed that together Australia and New Zealand will provide safe and effective vaccines to ensure comprehensive vaccine coverage for our Pacific family and Timor-Leste at the earliest opportunity. This complements COVAX vaccines, and doses delivered by the US and France.7. The Prime Ministers also confirmed New Zealand and Australia will continue to use a variety of mechanisms to securing and delivering vaccines, including through direct support and bilateral donations to COVAX, bilateral donations to individual countries, and working through multilateral agencies such as UNICEF. Australia and New Zealand are not just providing doses, but also wrap-around support including medical supplies, consumables and support for planning, training, communications and cold storage. Australia and New Zealand will constantly work with partners in the region to reassess needs as circumstances change.8. The Prime Ministers discussed plans for reconnecting our region with the rest of the world, and welcomed continued close coordination given the linked trans-Tasman border. They noted opportunities to collaborate on initiatives to extend travel options for Pacific neighbours when safe to do so, including through the trans-Tasman quarantine-free travel zone. This reflects our close ties to the Pacific and our commitment to supporting their recovery. Leaders also tasked officials to explore technological solutions to verify vaccination status to enable Australians and New Zealanders to reconnect with the wider world, alongside other technological solutions that support a safe reopening, while maintaining the trans-Tasman travel arrangements. Leaders expressed their desire to, as much as possible, write the reopening rulebook together. Pacific9. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the severe economic hardship the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for many countries in the Pacific, with tourism sectors particularly affected. They committed to continuing work already underway with Pacific governments, the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and other partners to support Pacific economies, helping affected communities and businesses. They agreed to continue advocacy with other partners for increased assistance to the region.10. The Prime Ministers recognised a unified Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) provides the best mechanism for our Pacific family to have a strong international voice, and achieve outcomes on priority regional challenges. They expressed hope that the Pacific Islands Forum Troika Plus political dialogue would identify solutions for the benefit of all PIF Members.11. The Prime Ministers welcomed the deep and continuing partnership between Australia, New\u00a0Zealand and Pacific island partners to address regional security issues including climate change, transnational organised crime, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing, cyber-security and cyber-crime, and corruption.12. The Prime Ministers welcomed the entry into force of the PACER Plus Trade and Development Agreement, under which Pacific island countries will benefit from increased economic activity encouraged by customs modernisation, harmonisation and a Development and Economic Cooperation work programme supported by a dedicated implementation unit. The Prime Ministers look forward to all Signatories to the Agreement ratifying and more Pacific island countries joining the agreement in order to realise its benefits of enhanced economic integration and inclusive growth. Trans-Tasman cooperation13. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed the importance of ongoing work under the Single Economic Market agenda to promote policy and regulatory coherence, and to support economic recovery. They acknowledged that the established trans-Tasman architecture had facilitated cooperation in response to COVID-19, including on two-way quarantine-free travel.14. Recognising the role of the digital economy as an enabler for all areas of the SEM agenda, the Prime Ministers welcomed agreement on a roadmap for mutual recognition of digital identity. They instructed officials to continue work towards interoperability on improving government services, payment practices policies, and the Consumer Data Right.15. The Prime Ministers welcomed continuing bilateral collaboration towards a responsible approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. They welcomed the ongoing joint implementation of the Trans-Tasman Cyber Security Research Programme and its projects. \u00a0They also supported bilateral and multilateral engagement on standards setting for critical and emerging technologies.16. The Prime Ministers agreed on the value of policy alignment on a circular economy and directed officials to work together on issues such as data collection on waste and material flows; sharing lessons on respective waste strategies; cooperation on marine plastics; and increasing capacity of onshore processing, which will have added benefits for Pacific Island countries given our shared role as recycling and waste management hubs for the region.17. The Prime Ministers instructed officials to establish a Supply Chain Dialogue, building on our respective existing and planned freight and supply chain strategies, to share experiences and seek opportunities for collaboration. They asked officials to share best practices for identifying and managing supply chain disruption risks and use this to drive information sharing and tangible joint action. They agreed addressing non\u2011tariff barriers will support supply chain resilience and committed to improving trans-Tasman regulatory coherence and resilience in the freight, transport and health sectors. They asked officials to explore opportunities to harness innovations from the pandemic response, and advance digital trade.18. Prime Ministers welcomed work between border agencies to deliver a more seamless border for traders that manages risk while also facilitating imports and exports across our economies. They directed officials to continue work on a secure trade lane between Australia and New\u00a0Zealand for low risk cargo, and on improving processes for border clearances, including through enhanced use of data and technology.19. The Prime Ministers encouraged officials to ensure our countries maintain strong biosecurity by harnessing technological developments, building on close bilateral cooperation on world-leading biosecurity risk auto-detection algorithms and 3D x-ray technology. They agreed to trial use of this technology through our respective biosecurity screening approaches, commencing with pre-screening of baggage and air cargo on commercial passenger services.20. The Prime Ministers recognised the importance of the Joint Food Standards System, underpinned by the Joint Food Standards System Agreement and supported by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Prime Ministers directed officials to continue work on how the System can be maintained and improved.21. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to mental health initiatives that provide best practice in mental health support in emergency response and recovery. They welcomed Australia\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 billion investment in mental health support and treatment and New Zealand\u2019s $1.9 billion investment in a programme of cross-government initiatives, and new services, to transform its mental health and addiction system.22. The Prime Ministers welcomed the passage of legislative amendments in Australia and New\u00a0Zealand to enable New\u00a0Zealanders to transfer unclaimed retirement savings in Australia into their KiwiSaver accounts. They instructed officials to update the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement to facilitate these transfers.23. The Prime Ministers reaffirmed Australia and New Zealand\u2019s growing focus on economic development opportunities, jobs and growth in the Indigenous business sector. They reflected on the success of the Virtual Indigenous Trade and Connections Event, and encouraged officials to continue to share policy experiences and data to support indigenous development, such as New Zealand\u2019s recently announced policies and targets for government procurement with M\u0101ori businesses in Aotearoa and Australia\u2019s Indigenous Procurement Policy. The Prime Ministers look forward to future trans-Tasman trade and policy missions between our Indigenous Peoples (as border restrictions allow), as well as ongoing partnership on the New\u00a0Zealand-led Te Aratini Global Indigenous Symposium at Expo 2020 Dubai.24. The Prime Ministers acknowledged continued science, research and innovation cooperation under the Australia-New Zealand Science, Research and Innovation Cooperation Agreement. They welcomed progress on the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SouthPAN) joint program, scheduled to be fully certified and operational by 2025. They also welcomed continuation of the Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Dialogue, establishment of an Indigenous STEM Dialogue, and further work towards the development of a Trans-Tasman Innovation Ecosystem. People-to-people ties25. The Prime Ministers welcomed the return of wh\u0101nau/family members, business travellers and tourists moving in both directions across the Tasman. Quarantine-free travel has reunited friends and family and provided a boost to the economic recovery in both countries, as well as enabling a resumption of face-to-face meetings between the Prime Ministers, Ministers and officials.26. The Prime Ministers re-affirmed the value of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, which provides for an exceptionally high degree of freedom of movement between the two countries. They acknowledged the support each country had provided to the other\u2019s citizens during COVID-19, including allowing those ordinarily resident in the other country to return home, and their inclusion of each other\u2019s citizens in respective COVID-19 wage subsidy programs.27. The Prime Ministers were pleased to confirm a change to the unique pathway to citizenship for New Zealanders living and working in Australia. From 1 July 2021, Australia will reduce the number of years in which applicants for the\u00a0New Zealand stream of the Skilled Independent (subclass 189) permanent residence visa\u00a0must reach the minimum income threshold (from\u00a0four years to three). Prime Ministers also welcomed Australia\u2019s\u00a0flexibility for applicants whose income or time offshore was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and\u00a0looked forward to a further review of the pathway visa in 2022.28. The Prime Ministers celebrated the successful bid for New Zealand and Australia to co\u2011host the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, one of the largest sporting events on the planet. \u00a0The Prime Ministers acknowledged the opportunity to use the event to achieve lasting social impact through sport for women and girls across our Indo-Pacific region. Climate change and the environment29. The Prime Ministers agreed on the importance of ambitious and practical action in pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. They agreed to sustain close and valuable cooperation on climate change, including in the Pacific and on agricultural emissions. The Prime Ministers recognised the important contribution that innovation and accelerating the deployment of technology will play in reducing emissions. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the strong link between climate change, oceans, and biodiversity.30. The Prime Ministers recognised the importance of protecting the ocean, including coral reef ecosystems, to build resilience and address biodiversity loss, along with tackling the growing problem of marine plastic pollution.31. The Prime Ministers recognised that climate change remains one of the most significant long-term security and development issues facing the Pacific region. New\u00a0Zealand and Australia will ensure their support for the Pacific\u2019s COVID-19 response and recovery aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement and helps build climate and disaster resilience.32. The Prime Ministers agreed to continue working closely with the Pacific to establish maritime zones and promote the preservation of these zones in the face of climate change-related sea-level rise. The Prime Ministers recognised fisheries will be a critical plank of the Pacific region\u2019s economic recovery from COVID-19, and reaffirmed their commitment to the sustainability of the region\u2019s fisheries and continuing to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing.33. The Prime Ministers emphasised the need for pragmatic solutions to address marine litter and other waste issues, and directed officials to incorporate these into their collaboration towards a circular economy. The Prime Ministers looked forward to the adoption of an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming in October 2021. Global trade34. The Prime Ministers reiterated their support for the multilateral trading system, and the importance of a well-functioning World Trade Organization (WTO) in promoting sustainable global economic growth and prosperity, including as part of the COVID-19 recovery.35. The Prime Ministers welcomed the election of WTO Director-General Okonjo-Iweala. They recommitted to working closely together, and with APEC partners, to deliver ambitious multilateral disciplines on fisheries subsidies by July, and a successful WTO 12th Ministerial Conference that delivers concrete outcomes and a pathway for meaningful reform. They emphasised the need for the WTO to be responsive to the pandemic through outcomes on trade and health, and welcomed joint efforts to strengthen disciplines to reduce trade- and production-distorting agriculture subsidies.

We appreciate the effort the company has gone to to deliver the first instalment earlier than originally anticipated. \u201cLast year we indicated the vaccine would arrive in quarter two, and earlier this year we updated that to quarter one. It\u2019s pleasing to be receiving doses this early in quarter one. \u201cThe arrival of our first batch of doses is an important milestone in our fight against COVID-19. We now anticipate further deliveries through quarter one from Pfizer. \u201cOur first priority is our border workers, who we expect to vaccinate within two to three weeks followed by their household contacts. Health care and essential workers and those most at risk from COVID-19 will follow in quarter two, before vaccination of the wider population in the second half of the year, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the first vaccinations to border workers were on track to be administered in the same week as the vaccine\u2019s arrival in New Zealand. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses and must be stored at -70 degrees centigrade. \u201cSystems and processes are in place for the first vaccinations to start once final checks have been completed, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cOn arrival, the vaccine must be independently tested for quality assurance, which is another important safety check. The doses will then be formally released to start the first phase of the vaccination programme. \u201cAt this stage, we are expecting to start offering the vaccine to our border and MIQ workers on 20th February, with the first immunisations given out to those working in the Auckland region, \u201d Chris Hipkins said.",

        "content": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has chaired a meeting of Leaders representing the 21 APEC economies overnight. \u201cFor the first time in APEC\u2019s history Leaders have come together for an extraordinary meeting focused exclusively on COVID-19, and how our region can navigate out of the worst health and economic crisis in living memory, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cFront of mind for leaders is achieving widespread access for vaccines globally and working collaboratively to provide them to everyone as soon as possible. \u201cOur discussions moved us beyond vaccine nationalism. Now we are focusing on all aspects of contributing to the global vaccination effort \u2013 making vaccines, sharing vaccines and using vaccines. \u201cNobody is safe from this virus until everyone is safe. Ensuring both global vaccine access and uptake is as high as possible in the shortest time possible gives our regional and individual economies the greatest chance to accelerate recovery, and will support greater economic stability. \u201cWe are also pushing for collaborative and practical solutions on safely reconnecting with the world by continuing to explore options including vaccine passports, travel green lanes and quarantine-free travel bubbles. This is a challenge to which we are working hard to find creative solutions. \u201cWe have the opportunity to build back better and emerge from this crisis more inclusive, more sustainable and more adaptable than ever, and in order to achieve this as fast as possible - we need to do it together, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said. Leaders also discussed a range of other matters relating to the pandemic including:Individual domestic approaches to the ongoing management of COVID-19;The evolving strains and health dimensions of COVID-19, with APEC helping speed the flow of vaccines;Fiscal and monetary tools available to sustain economies through the pandemic, with the importance of keeping markets open to one another. Leading a regional health, trade and economic response to the pandemic has been one of New Zealand\u2019s priorities as APEC 2021 Chair. Today\u2019s meeting builds on progress made at APEC Trade, Structural Reform and Finance Ministers\u2019 meetings from last month and sets a strong foundation for when APEC Leaders meet again in November. \u201cLeaders have set strong expectations of the outcomes we want in November to support the COVID-19 recovery. These include making sure that APEC economies have lowered tariffs on vaccines moving across borders, and that economies have accelerated digitalisation of border paperwork, reducing costs on businesses, \u201d Jacinda Ardern said.",

Further announcements on use of these vaccines will be made in due course, \u201d Chris Hipkins said. \u201cThe Pfizer vaccine is being rolled out right across New Zealand, including to our hard to reach and rural areas. We are continuing to focus on reaching at least 90% vaccination rates across all DHBs. \u201cWe have the ability to deliver vaccines right across Aotearoa New Zealand, quickly and efficiently, and there is enough vaccines right now for every eligible person to be fully vaccinated. \u201d",

In October, the Government signed an agreement to purchase 1.5 million COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 enough for 750,000 people \u2013 from Pfizer and BioNTech, subject to the vaccine successfully completing all clinical trials and passing regulatory approvals in New Zealand. \u201cAs part of the agreement, vaccine delivery to New Zealand could be as early as the first quarter of 2021. Provided the vaccine is approved for use in New Zealand by Medsafe, it is possible that some doses will be available to us in the first part of 2021, \u201d Megan Woods said. \u201cMedsafe is working to optimise its processes so that any promising vaccines will be fully assessed as quickly as possible against the same criteria used for all other medicines that enter New Zealand. \u201cPfizer and BioNTech will keep us up to date as to when data will be available for Medsafe to begin its evaluation process, \u201d Megan Woods said. Megan Woods said the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Taskforce, led by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, is currently negotiating with other pharmaceutical companies, and further announcements are expected in November. \u201cThe agreement with Pfizer and BioNTech is one of a number of negotiations underway as part of our portfolio approach, and good progress is being made in relation to other purchasing negotiations. The additional agreements will ensure that once the portfolio is completed, we will have sufficient COVID-19 vaccines for the whole population, \u201d Megan Woods said. The Ministry of Health is developing a sequencing framework to guide the rollout of the vaccines as they become available. The Ministry of Health is preparing for a range of vaccine scenarios and will finalise the expected vaccination approach once the features of a vaccine and the supply that will initially be available are known. \u00a0However, three broad groups are being considered:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those at risk of spreading COVID-19\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those at risk of contracting COVID-19\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those at risk of increased morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. \u201cEnsuring equity of outcomes is a key measure of success, including protection for M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples and our most vulnerable population groups, such as older people, disabled people, health workers, essential workers and border staff. The Government has set aside $66.3 million for medical supplies and infrastructure to ensure New Zealand is ready to launch a COVID-19 Immunisation Programme as soon as we have a safe and effective vaccine, \u201d \u00a0Megan Woods said.",

That means seven DHBs in total have now nailed this mark, with a number of others about to reach it in the coming days. \u201cAnd the work continues. By 11.59pm last night, 3,789,662 of the 4,209,057 eligible New Zealanders aged 12 and over were fully vaccinated, with 3,969,267 (or 94%) partially vaccinated. \u201cWe know we still have more to do, and we will be continuing the mahi to further raise vaccination rates in those areas where it\u2019s most needed \u2013 as well as among our M\u0101ori and Pacific communities to bring them closer to that 90 per cent fully vaccinated mark. \u201cThat\u2019s why I encourage everyone in Aotearoa who is eligible for the vaccine to go ahead and get their shot, whether it be their first, second or a booster dose. \u201cThere are hundreds of places open until Christmas and over the summer holidays where you can get your vaccination, so it\u2019s never been easier. \u201cThere\u2019s also a ton of really good information available from official, trusted sources, which is a good place to start for anyone who still has questions. \u201cThis includes the key websites -www.covid19.govt.nz, www.health.govt.nz, www.karawhiua.nz, www.mpp.govt.nz, or your health provider. \u00a0Healthline is another great place to have your questions answered \u2013 call 0800 28 29 26. \u201cWe want all of our communities protected against COVID-19, and no-one who\u2019s eligible to be left behind. \u201d",

        "content": "The Crown accounts are in a solid position thanks to the Government\u2019s careful financial management through a deteriorating global environment. For the four months to the end of October, the Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) recorded a deficit of $2.8 billion, $274 million lower than forecast at Budget 2022 in May and $5 billion lower than for the same period a year ago. Tax revenue also came in slightly below expectations. \u201cThe economy is continuing to show its resilience even as global economic storm clouds gather. The sobering reality is global growth is slowing and New Zealand will not escape its impact, with forecasts of a shallow recession next year, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cGovernment actions to grow the economy and support Kiwis means New Zealand is well-positioned to face these global challenges with a solid balance sheet, near record low unemployment, more people in paid work and wages increasing. \u201cWe know that Kiwis are finding it tough as they face cost of living pressures and rising interest rates. The Government is doing its bit to soften the impact, including through the recently announced childcare package. \u201cNew forecasts out today show food and fibre export revenue are projected to reach new record highs of $55 billion in the coming year, in part a result of the six new trade agreements and upgrades the Government has secured since 2017. In addition to growing our exports, tourists are returning in greater numbers which will all go some way to help protect New Zealanders from the sharp edges of the global downturn. \u201cThe deteriorating global situation will flow through to the Government\u2019s books. The Treasury\u2019s Half year Fiscal and Economic Update on 14 December will provide more detail onits likely impact on New Zealand, but the direction of travel is clear. \u201cIt is important that we continue to carefully and responsibly manage our finances. Government spending as a percentage of GDP is expected to fall over the forecast period and contribute less each year to overall domestic demand. Tough choices, however, will be required on the pathway back to surplus. \u201dCore Crown tax revenue was $62 million below forecast at $36.2 billion, due to lower-than-expected GST returns and lower Fuel Excise Duties and Road Users Charges, which were cut to support New Zealanders with cost of living pressures. Core Crown expenses were $515 million above forecast at $41.8 billion, due to higher interest costs and health expenses, including the timing of vaccine charges that occurred during this period. Net debt stood at 19.5 percent of GDP, which was above forecast mainly due to market conditions affecting the New Zealand Super Fund\u2019s financial portfolio. Using the old measure, net core Crown debt was below forecast at 39.4 percent of GDP compared with projections of 40.4 percent of GDP. \u201cOur debt levels are among the lowest in the OECD and well below the Government\u2019s debt ceiling of 30 percent, ensuring we are well positioned to weather further economic shocks, \u201d Grant Robertson said. \u201cIn these highly uncertain global economic times, we continue to take a balanced approach that has worked for New Zealand. We remain focused on prioritising our spending without adding to inflation pressures and returning to surplus in 2024/25, which would be a year earlier than the National Government did after the Global Financial Crisis. \u201d",

These programmes will help parents better support their children to be more resilient, \u201d Andrew Little said. The programmes were made available to parents during last year\u2019s Delta lockdown in Auckland with very positive feedback, and from this week will be available to parents anywhere in the country. \u201cWe know COVID-19 has caused stress for many families with worries about money, work and schooling. While these issues are separate, all of them can affect mental health. This is about supporting parents and children to manage their wellbeing over the long term, \u201d Andrew Little said. \u201cWe know by investing early in psychosocial supports, some of the personal effects of COVID-19 can be minimised, and long-term mental wellbeing can be better supported, \u201d Andrew Little said. The programmes are funded as part of the Government\u2019s $5.6 million psychosocial package announced in November.

        "content": "Wh\u0101nau Ora and Associate Health (M\u0101ori Health) Minister Peeni Henare acknowledges two major milestones in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme forM\u0101ori. \u201cI am very pleased to announcemore than 50 percent of eligible M\u0101orihave received their first dose and 25 per cent are now fully vaccinated, \u201d Peeni Henare said. \u201cThismeans over285,000 of eligible M\u0101ori have had their first dose. This is fantastic news and demonstrates that the wh\u0101nau-based approach we have taken across the roll-out is working. \u201cThe success of vaccination rates increasing in our M\u0101ori communities is due to the mahi being led by ourM\u0101ori Health Providers and Wh\u0101nau Ora Provider Network. They are leading a wh\u0101nau-centred approach, providing outreach in hard-to-reach communities and taking the extra step to ensure the needs of our wh\u0101nau are met. \u201cI want to mihi to all the kaimahi across the motu who are working hard to support our wh\u0101nau. Thank you so much for all you\u2019ve done and continue to do for our people. \u201cI acknowledge our three leading district health boards in first dose vaccinations: Southern, 58.7%, Capital and Coast, 58.4% and T\u0101maki Makaurau, 52.8%. \u201cM\u0101ori Health Providers are rolling out many different approaches available to wh\u0101nau across the motu. \u201cBut there is still more mahi to be done. That is why I am proud to support the work the Wh\u0101nau Ora Commissioning Agency and Te Wh\u0101nau o Waipareira\u2019s Fight for your whakapapa campaign launching today. \u201cTe Wh\u0101nau o Waipareira have led an innovative wh\u0101nau-first vaccination response in T\u0101maki Makaurau despite the challenges of the Alert Level 4 lockdown. They quickly set up drive-through vaccinations and allowed walk-ins to enable wh\u0101nau to come at times convenient to them, and now are leading the rollout of the \u2018Shot Bro\u2019 bus across hard-to-reach communities\u201d\u201cStarting Monday the 08004MAORI phone line will operate 7 days a week between 8am-8pm, while also using popular Auckland radio stations and social media platforms to keep wh\u0101nau updated on where the mobile vaccination bus will be in the community. \u201cFrom the start of the vaccination rollout I have said that this is about protecting our wh\u0101nau and our whakapapa but this is not a one size fits all approach. \u201cThere is currently a range of vaccination options available forM\u0101oriincluding walk in vaccination centres, pharmacies, GPs, mobile and pop-up clinics, mass vaccinations, workplace events, drive-through centres and marae-based programmes. \u201cEveryone is playing their part in the push to get all M\u0101orivaccinated, including Turanga Health who are providing local M\u0101ori vaccination training and the Southern District Health Board which is working with M\u0101ori health providers to vaccinate shearing gangs in rural and remote areas across the district. \u201cWe\u2019ve had M\u0101ori wardens in Kaikoura helping with the vaccine rollout to their M\u0101ori population over 75, resulting in a 100 percent vaccination rate for this population; Ng\u0101ti Hine Health Trust opening a vaccination centre in Whang\u0101rei; Northland iwi opening a mobile vaccination service; a community vaccination centre has opened in Tokoroa; Muriwhenua kura are leading door-to-door vaccination drives in the Far North, and targeted M\u0101ori vaccination centres in Taranaki are boosting vaccination rates. These are but a few initiatives being driven by M\u0101ori for M\u0101ori. \u201cI want to give a special shout-out to Natasha Kemp, Chief Executive of Manurewa Marae, who initiated a walk-in service for rangatahi M\u0101ori that has seen an increase in vaccination uptake as a result. \u201cAll of these initiatives are proving a huge success and ensure that M\u0101orican access culturally safe services that meet their needs. We know this is critical to boosting the vaccination uptake rate and ensuring equitable outcomes for M\u0101ori. \u201cWhile these figures are cause for celebration, we cannot afford to become complacent. It is vitally important thatM\u0101oricontinue to get themselves vaccinated not just for themselves, but for their kaumatua, their tamariki, and their communities. \u201cMy number one message is come forward, get vaccinated. Once you are vaccinated, this helps make sure that you and your friends and wh\u0101nau have the best protection against COVID-19, \u201d Peeni Henare said.
